1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>This Account, which is intended to describe the country as it
stood previously to the war with the British, commencing in the
end of the year 1814, is derived chiefly from the following
sources.</p>
<p>In the first place, during the years 1802 and 1803, I passed
fourteen months in the country, mostly in the vicinity of
Kathmandu, the capital; and I was accompanied by Ramajai
Batacharji, an intelligent Brahman, from Calcutta, whom I
employed to obtain information, so far as I prudently could,
without alarming a jealous government, or giving offence to the
Resident, under whose authority I was acting.</p>
<p>In the next place, assisted by the same person, I passed two
years on the frontier, collecting information, both from the
Company&rsquo;s subjects, and from numerous refugees and
travellers from the dominions of Gorkha.&nbsp; The following are
the persons to whose information I am chiefly indebted:</p>
<p>The account of Sikim is chiefly taken from a Lama, or priest
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>of Buddha, who, with part of his flock, had fled into the
district of Puraniya, to escape from the violence of the
Gorkhalese, and who constructed a map of the country, which I
have deposited in the Company&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; Besides the
Lama, I consulted many of the natives of the Company&rsquo;s
territory, who had visited the lower parts of Sikim, and several
of the Gorkhalese, and other people of Nepal; and Mr Smith, of
Nathpur, favoured me with several particulars, collected by a Mr
Pagan for the information of government.</p>
<p>Concerning the country between Sikim and Nepal Proper, my
information is chiefly derived from the following persons:</p>
<p>1<i>st</i>, Agam Singha, hereditary chief of the Kirats, a
tribe bordering immediately on Nepal, and last Chautariya, or
prime minister, of the princes who governed that people.</p>
<p>2<i>d</i>, A Brahman, who was the Munsuf, or civil judge of
Bahadurgunj, a territory in the district of Puraniya belonging to
the Company.&nbsp; His ancestors were hereditary Dewans to the
princes who governed the territory between Nepal and Sikim, that
is, the Brahman&rsquo;s family managed the princes&rsquo;
revenue.</p>
<p>3<i>d</i>, From Narayan Das, a scribe, (Kayastha,) whose
ancestor Janardan accompanied Lohanga, founder of the late
dynasty; and whose descendants enjoyed the hereditary office of
Neb, or second minister to the successors of that chief, until
their final expulsion from the mountains.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>, A slave of the Raja of Gorkha, who entered into my
service in order to bring plants from the Alpine regions; but,
finding him very intelligent, and a great traveller, I employed
him to construct a map, which I have deposited in the
Company&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; In order to enable himself to
execute this with more care, he refreshed his memory by several
journeys in different directions.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>, A Kirat from Hedang, near the Arun river, gave me
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>another map, which has also been deposited in the
Company&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; It contains only the eastern parts
of the territory in question.</p>
<p>These two maps, together with that of the Lama, as might be
expected, are very rude, and differ in several points; but they
coincide in a great many more, so as to give considerable
authority to their general structure; and, by a careful
examination of the whole, many differences, apparently
considerable, may be reconciled.&nbsp; The general authority of
the whole is confirmed by our maps, so far as they go, and by the
intelligence which Colonel Crawford obtained in Nepal.</p>
<p>The account of Nepal Proper is chiefly derived from my own
observations, assisted by those of Ramajai above mentioned and by
some communications with which I was favoured by Colonel
Crawford, now Surveyor-General in Bengal.&nbsp; He favoured me,
in particular, with several drawings of the snowy mountains; and,
by orders of the Marquis Wellesley, then Governor-General, I was
furnished with copies of Colonel Crawford&rsquo;s valuable
geographical surveys and maps of the country.</p>
<p>In one point respecting these maps, I consider myself bound to
do justice to the researches of Colonel Crawford.&nbsp; From a
treatise on the sources of the Ganges, given by H. T. Colebrooke,
Esq. in the 11th volume of the Asiatick Researches, page 429,
etc. it might be possibly inferred, although this, perhaps, was
not intended to be expressed, that Colonel Colebrooke and his
kinsman were induced to reject the authority of D&rsquo;Anville
respecting the sources of the Ganges, merely from examining the
authorities, upon which the course of the Ganges above Haridwar
had been laid down in the geographical charts then in use.&nbsp;
Now, the fact is, that Colonel Colebrooke had other grounds for
rejecting the authority of D&rsquo;Anville, and especially one of
the above-mentioned maps, which <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>had been
officially communicated to him by Colonel Crawford.&nbsp; In this
map the sources of the Ganges are laid down from the reports of
pilgrims; nor has the survey, carried on by the suggestion of
Colonel Colebrooke, added any thing material, so far as relates
to the general outlines of these sources.&nbsp; By this
observation I by no means intend to depreciate the labours of Mr
Webb, by whom the survey was conducted; nor the judgment and love
of science evinced in the recommendation of Colonel Colebrooke to
employ him.&nbsp; So long as the matter rested entirely on the
report of pilgrims, doubts would exist; and the survey has not
only entirely removed these, but has given us many details of a
country previously unknown.</p>
<p>Concerning the country between Nepal Proper and the river
Kali, I follow chiefly the authority of the following persons:
1<i>st</i>, a Brahman, named Sadhu Ram Upadhyaya, whose family
was in hereditary possession of the office of priest (Purohit)
for the Raja of Palpa, one of the principal chiefs in this
district; 2<i>d</i> and 3<i>d</i>, Prati Nidhi Tiwari, and Kanak
Nidhi Tiwari, two brothers of the sacred order, the former very
learned, and the latter a man of business.&nbsp; Their family had
been long Mantris, or advisers of the same chiefs, but came
originally from Kumau; 4<i>th</i>, Samar Bahadur, uncle to the
Raja of Palpa, now in exile.</p>
<p>Two maps of these parts, now in the Company&rsquo;s library,
were prepared by Sadhu Ram and Kanak Nidhi, with the assistance
of Kamal Lochan, one of the natives attached to the survey of
Bengal, on which I was engaged.&nbsp; Although they differ in
some points, they agree in so many more, especially in the
eastern parts, that considerable reliance may be placed on their
giving some tolerable idea of the country.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the parts west of the river Kali, in the
rainy season 1814 I proceeded up the Ganges, with a view of <!--
page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>going to Haridwar, where I expected to procure
intelligence; but, fortunately, I met at Futtehgur with a person
well qualified for the purpose.&nbsp; This was Hariballabh, a
Brahman born in Kumau, but who has been long in the service of
the Garhawal Rajas, and has travelled much in the adjacent
parts.&nbsp; A map of the western parts of the dominions of
Gorkha, now also in the Company&rsquo;s library, was composed by
Hariballabh, with the assistance of Kamal Lochan.&nbsp; The same
person gave me another map explaining the country, which extends
some way west from the Sutluj, and of which a short account will
be found in the Appendix.</p>
<p>I regret, that, on the banks of the Karanali, there intervenes
a space, with which none of my informants were well acquainted,
its communications being entirely with the country belonging to
the Nawab Vazir.</p>
<p>I shall have very frequent occasion to mention the account of
Nepal by Colonel Kirkpatrick; and, although I often differ from
him in opinion, and think it my duty to state these points fully,
yet no one can be more sensible, knowing well the difficulties he
encountered, of the merits of his work, which is, on the whole,
perfectly conformable to his well-known thirst for information
and judgment in the acquisition of knowledge.&nbsp; I must here,
however, in a general way, caution the reader to place little
confidence in the names given in the printed work.&nbsp; I have
no doubt, that the numerous errors in the names are to be
attributed to the printing of the work having been entrusted to
some person entirely ignorant of the native language; and who,
therefore, could not be led, by a knowledge of this, to read the
names in the manuscript with accuracy.&nbsp; But, besides this
source of error, in some degree, perhaps, unavoidable, the
printer seems to have been uncommonly careless in reading even
those names that are known to Europeans.&nbsp; Thus, (in <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>page 131,) speaking of the birds of Nepal, he has as
follows: &ldquo;The two last belong to the genus of pheasants,
the damphia being of the golden, and the monal of the argheer, or
spotted sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can be no doubt, that Colonel
Kirkpatrick wrote argus, and not argheer, which has no
meaning.</p>
<p>The utmost negligence may be also observed in a matter of more
importance; for, in the route from Kathmandu to Beni, the capital
of Malebum, given in page 290, all the stages from Deoralli 1st,
to Ragho Powa, both inclusive, are evidently transposed, as going
through the territory of Lamjun and Kaski, after having entered
Malebum at Kusmachoor, while both Lamjun and Kaski are between
Kathmandu and Malebum.&nbsp; I suspect, also, that the person
entrusted with the printing has introduced some matter of his own
about the Hindu religion, several passages on that subject being
unlike the sentiments of a person of Colonel Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s
known sense and observation.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>Nepal, a name celebrated in Hindu legend, in a strict sense,
ought to be applied to that country only which is in the vicinity
of Kathmandu, the capital; but at present it is usually given to
the whole territory of the Gorkha Rajas, which occupies about
thirteen degrees of longitude, and five of latitude.&nbsp; It is
my intention now to give an account of the whole of this
territory, so far as has come to my knowledge.</p>
<p>East from the territory called Nepal Proper, the mountains
were chiefly occupied by a tribe called Kirat or Kichak, who, in
remote times, seem to have made extensive conquests in the plains
of Kamrup and Matsya, now constituting the districts of Ranggapur
and Dinajpur.&nbsp; Although these conquests had long been lost
to the Kirats, yet Father Giuseppe, who witnessed the conquest of
Nepal by the Gorkhalese, and gives a good account of the horrid
circumstances attending that event, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> considers the Kiratas
(Ciratas) in the year 1769 as being an independent nation.&nbsp;
Now, although this would not appear to be strictly exact, as the
Kirats had then been long <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>subject to Rajput princes; yet the
Father is abundantly justifiable in what he has advanced; for the
Kirats formed the principal strength of these Rajput chiefs,
their hereditary chief held the second office in the state,
(Chautariya,) and the Rajputs, who were united with them, did not
presume to act as masters, to invade their lands, or violate
their customs.&nbsp; These Kirats are frequently mentioned in
Hindu legend as occupying the country between Nepal and Madra,
the ancient denomination in Hindu writings for the country which
we call Bhotan.</p>
<p>Towards the west again, the country between Nepal and Kasmir,
over which the present rulers of the former have far extended
their dominion, in the ancient Hindu writings is called Khas, and
its inhabitants Khasiyas.&nbsp; I am told, that, wherever
mentioned in ancient records, like the Kirats, their neighbours
to the west, the Khasiyas are considered as abominable and impure
infidels.</p>

<p>The numerous valleys among the prodigious mountains, of which
Nepal in its extended sense consists, are inhabited by various
tribes, that differ very much in language, and somewhat in
customs.&nbsp; All that have any sort of pretensions to be
considered as aboriginal, like their neighbours of Bhotan to the
east, are, by their features, clearly marked as belonging to the
Tartar or Chinese race of men, and have no sort of resemblance to
the Hindus.</p>
<p>The time when the Hindus penetrated into these regions is very
uncertain.&nbsp; Bhim Sen, the son of Pandu, is said to have
penetrated into these parts, and probably was the first who <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>introduced any sort of improvement.&nbsp; He still
continues to be a favourite object with the rude tribes, not only
on the mountains, but in their vicinity.&nbsp; Probably at no
great distance from the time of that prince, and about the
commencement of our era, Sakya, the last great teacher of the
Bouddhists, passed through the country, and settled at Lasa,
where he is supposed to be still alive in the person whom we call
the Grand Lama.&nbsp; His followers seem to have acquired a great
ascendancy over all the tribes of Nepal, as well as in Thibet and
Bhotan, which they retained until a subsequent colony of Hindus
settled in the first of these countries, and introduced the
Brahmans, who have had considerable success in destroying the
heretical doctrines, although these have still numerous
votaries.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick, or perhaps rather his editor, seems to
have entertained a very different opinion concerning the period
when the Hindus penetrated into Nepal.&nbsp; Speaking of
Sambhunath, he says, <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> &ldquo;After all, it
is highly probable that the sanctity of this spot might be safely
referred to a period very anterior both to the Newar and Khat
Bhotiya dynasties (who preceded the Newars) of Nepaul, since the
sacred books of the Hindus leave scarcely any room to doubt, that
the religion of Brahma has been established from the most remote
antiquity in this secluded valley, where there are nearly as many
idols as inhabitants, there not being a fountain, a river, or
hill within its limits, that is not consecrated to one or other
of the Hindu deities.&rdquo;&nbsp; What idea the author may have
held of the terms Hindu and religion of Brahma, I cannot
say.&nbsp; If he meant by Hindu whatever colonists may have come
from the plains, I agree with him, and have stated, that Bhim Sen
and Sakya Singha seem, in early ages, to have penetrated into
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>the mountains, and to have introduced
civilization.&nbsp; But I think him mistaken, if, by Hindu, he
means the followers of the present Brahmans, introduced into
India from Saka Dwip by the son of Krishna, contemporary with
Bhim Sen; and if, by the religion of Brahma, he means the
doctrine taught by these Brahmans, who do not, however, worship
that deity.&nbsp; In the first place, I have been assured, that,
in the sacred books of the Hindus, that is to say, in the Puranas
attributed to Vayasa, the Khas and Kiratas, the ancient
inhabitants of the mountains, are always spoken of as impure
infidels.&nbsp; Again, the number of idols and places consecrated
in Nepal to the Hindu gods is no sort of proof that the doctrines
of the Brahmans have existed long in the country; for the
Bouddhists, who follow the doctrine of Sakya, admit of the
worship of the same inferior deities (Devatas) with the Brahmans,
both having probably adopted their worship from sects that had
previously existed.&nbsp; Farther, the changes in the names of
places, since the Hindu conquest, has been rapid almost beyond
conception; for instance, the capitals of the three
principalities into which Nepal was divided, and which are now
called Kathmandu, Lalita Patana, and Bhatgang, and which, in
1802, I always heard called by these names, were, during the
Newar government, which ended in 1767, called Yin Daise, Yulloo
Daise, and Khopo Daise. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; To these
circumstances, explanatory of the author&rsquo;s mistake, I must
add the statements, which will follow, and which reduce the
arrival of the present Hindu colonies to a modern period, or to
the fourteenth century of the Christian era.</p>
<p>According to the traditions most commonly current in Nepal,
the Hindus of the mountains (Parbatiya) left their own <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>country in consequence of an invasion by the Muhammedan
king of Dilli, who wished to marry a daughter of the Raja of
Chitor, or Chitaur, celebrated for her beauty.&nbsp; A refusal
brought on the destruction of her father and his capital city;
and, to avoid a hateful yoke, many of the people fled to the
hills.&nbsp; A somewhat similar story, related in the translation
of Fereshtah by Dow, would seem to verify the truth of the
tradition, and fix its date to the 1306 year of our era.</p>
<p>In opposition to this tradition, very generally received at
Kathmandu, and throughout the eastern parts of the Nepalese
dominions, Hariballabh contends, that there was a certain Asanti,
a prince descended of Shalivahana in the seventh or eighth
generation, and who, therefore, should have lived in about the
second or third century of the Christian era, but whom
Hariballabh supposes to have lived seven or eight hundred years
ago, in which case the Shalivahana from whom he was descended
must have been different from the prince whose name has been
given to an era.&nbsp; Asanti came to these mountains, and
established a kingdom extending from Pesaur to Morang, and having
for its capital Karuvirpur, a town near Almorha.&nbsp; His
descendants were called Suryabangsi Rajputs, and with them came
pure Brahmans, whose doctrines gradually gained ground by the
addition of colonists, and the progress of generation.&nbsp; This
progress would appear to have been very slow, for I cannot find,
even in Kumau, the seat of the first colonists, that there are
now any other Brahmans, except those called the Brahmans of
Kumau, a colony avowedly introduced from Kanoj by Thor Chandra,
who lived after the middle of the fifteenth century of the
Christian era, and, therefore, subsequent to the colony from
Chitaur.&nbsp; The country had previously been inhabited by Jars,
Magars, and other impure and infidel tribes, and great numbers of
these continued under the descendants <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of Asanti as
cultivators; but, west of the Soyal, there was no Raja who was
not of pure birth, although the barbarous chiefs continued to
hold most of the country east from thence, tributary, however, to
the descendants of Shalivahana.&nbsp; Hariballabh remembers the
names of only the three first of Asanti&rsquo;s successors,
namely, Basanti, Dham Deva, and Brahma Deva; but his descendants
continued, for a considerable time, to enjoy a supremacy over the
chiefs of the hills, although their power was much reduced by
family dissensions, and by appanages granted to collateral
branches.&nbsp; Various turbulent chiefs, that successively came
from the low country, took advantage of this weakness to reduce
the authority of the descendants of Asanti to a jurisdiction
nearly nominal; and, in the reign of Akbur, the government of
Karuvirpur was totally overturned by the petty chief of Kumau,
who pretended to be of the ancient family of the moon, and whose
ancestors, a few generations before, had succeeded, by an
abominable act of treachery, in obtaining a settlement in the
hills.&nbsp; Indeed, it is generally admitted, even by
themselves, that all, or at least most of the chiefs, who came
from the low country, used similar means, that is, entered into
the service of the mountaineers, and, having gained their
confidence by a superior knowledge and polish of manners,
contrived to put them to death, and to seize their country.</p>
<p>This conduct is justified, in their opinion, by their having
abolished the impure and abominable customs that previously
existed among the mountaineers; and, in conformity with this
common principle, all the chiefs west of the river Kali glory in
having either totally expelled or extirpated the original
inhabitants, and in having established, in its full height, the
purity of the Hindu doctrines.</p>
<p>To the east of the Kali river, the chiefs have not been <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>actuated by so pure a zeal, and not only have permitted
many of the mountain tribes to remain and practise their
abominations, but have themselves relaxed, in many essential
points, from the rules of cast, and have debased their blood by
frequent intermixtures with that of the mountaineers; while such
of these as chose to embrace the slender degree of purity
required in these parts, have been admitted to the high dignities
of the military order.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the parts west from the river Kali, the Hindus
from the south have not, in fact, been so bad as they pretend;
and, although no one is willing to acknowledge a deficiency of
zeal, or a descent from barbarians, yet, in fact, they may have
permitted to remain such of the cultivators as chose to adopt the
rules of purity, and to take the name of Sudras.&nbsp; I have not
seen a sufficient number of the people from that part of the
country to enable me to judge how far this may have been the
case; for all the original tribes of the mountains, as already
stated, have strongly marked Chinese or Tartar countenances, when
the breed has not been improved by a mixture with people of more
elegant features.</p>
<p>According to Sadu Ram and Samar Bahadur, when the colony from
Chitaur, mentioned above, arrived at the mountains east from the
Kali, in the beginning of the fourteenth century of the Christian
era, they found the whole occupied by impure or infidel tribes,
nor for some time did any of the sacred order, nor any
descendants of the colony, extend beyond the limits of their
conquests.&nbsp; Gradually, however, the descendants of the
colony, and especially the members of the sacred order, who
indulged very much in promiscuous amours, spread wide over the
mountainous region, and multiplied exceedingly, introducing
everywhere, as much as possible, the modern doctrines of purity
and law, modified, however, a good deal, to <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>accommodate
it to the licence which the mountaineers exercised in the
intercourse of the sexes, and in eating.&nbsp; In this conversion
the Brahmans have had great success, and most of the chiefs of
the highland tribes have adopted the rules of purity, and are
called Rajputs, while various fables and genealogies have been
contrived to gratify their vanity, by connecting their history
with Hindu legend.</p>
<p>Concerning the colony from Chitaur I received another account,
from the Mahanta, or prior of the convent of Janmasthan, at
Ayodhya.&nbsp; He alleges, that Chaturbhuja, a prince of the
Sisaudhiya tribe, having left Chitaur, conquered Kumau and
Yumila, where he established his throne, from whence his family
spread to Palpa Tanahung and the Kirats.&nbsp; The supremacy very
lately admitted by all the eastern mountain chiefs to the Rajas
of Yumila, is a strong presumption in favour of this
opinion.&nbsp; Many chiefs, and especially the Palpa Tanahung and
Makwanpur families, pretend to be descended of the Chitaur
princes; but it is very doubtful whether they have any claim to a
descent so illustrious, for the Mahanta said, that, after some
generations, all the hill chiefs rebelled, and paid only a
nominal obedience to the Raja of Yumila, nor does Samar Bahadur,
uncle of the Palpa Raja, claim kindred with that chief, while one
of the branches of his family still remains impure.&nbsp; But, if
this tradition be well-founded, the Yumila, or Kumau
principality, or at least its possession by the Rajputs, must
have been subsequent to 1306, which will not admit of above
twenty-five generations, instead of the fifty or sixty which the
Brahmans of that country allot for the arrival of Asanti.&nbsp;
This difference may, however, be explained.&nbsp; Chaturbhuja, as
well as a fortunate Brahman, who obtained Malebum, as will be
afterwards mentioned, may have married the daughter of the former
chief of Yumila, and thus succeeded to <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the power;
and the fifty or sixty generations, in both cases, may include
both the original family, and those who succeeded by
marriage.&nbsp; But, if the Mahanta is right, the Yumila or
Karuvir family, in place of being descended of Shalivahana, was
descended of the princes of Ajmir and Chitaur.</p>
<p>In giving an account of the tribes now occupying the dominions
of Nepal, I shall first commence with these Hindu colonists, as
having acquired the predominance; but I must premise, that very
considerable differences prevail in their customs in different
parts, and especially that those in the countries east from the
Kali differ much from those who live west from that river.&nbsp;
I shall commence with the former, with whom I am best
acquainted.</p>
<p>The language spoken by the mountain Hindus in the vicinity of
Kathmandu, is usually called the Parbatiya basha, or mountain
dialect; but west from the capital, it is more commonly known by
the name of Khas basha, or dialect of the Khas country, because
it seems to have been first introduced into the territory of that
name.&nbsp; I have lodged in the Company&rsquo;s library a
copious vocabulary of this dialect, from whence the learned may
judge how far it is probable that it came from Chitor; for there
can be no doubt, that it is a dialect of the Hindwi language, and
it is making rapid progress in extinguishing the aboriginal
dialects of the mountains.</p>
<p>The character in which this language is written is evidently
derived from the Nagri, and may be found in Colonel
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Account of Nepaul, opposite to page 220; and
in the twenty-eight following pages may be seen a short
vocabulary.</p>
<p>East from the Kali, the Brahmans, who are of pure birth, are
only few in number, there being no means for their subsistence,
as they confine themselves mostly to the duties of the sacred
order.&nbsp; They are of the Kanoj nation, and the sect of the
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Saktis, following chiefly the doctrine of the books
called Tantras.&nbsp; Where the chiefs who pretend to have come
from Chitaur settled, many of them were men of great
learning.&nbsp; In other parts, very few have made any sort of
progress in grammar, law, or philosophy; but they are considered
as profound astrologers.&nbsp; Although very few have taken
service either from men or in temples, they contaminate
themselves by uncommon liberties in the gratification of their
appetites.&nbsp; They are divided into three ranks that do not
intermarry.&nbsp; The highest are called Jayurbedi, from the
sacred book which they profess to follow, and they assume the
title of Upadhyaya.&nbsp; These are the instructors (Gurus) and
priests (Purohits) for Brahmans and Rajputs, and eat goats,
sheep, and some kinds of wild fowl, but abstain from
venison.&nbsp; The two lower orders are called Kamiya and Purubi,
and act as instructors and priests for the lower orders.&nbsp;
These not only eat the same animals as those of the highest rank,
but many of them rear fowls and swine for their tables.</p>
<p>The sixteen principal festivals observed by the mountain
Hindus have been described by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> nor have I any additional information
to offer.</p>
<p>All the Brahmans may keep widows of their own class as
concubines, and the spurious offspring of such connections are
called Jausis.&nbsp; These, having betaken themselves to
agriculture and commerce, have become exceedingly numerous, and
are reduced to perform every kind of drudgery.&nbsp; Among the
poor people whom I observed coming to the markets in the
Gorakhpur district, loaded with goods even from the distant hills
of Malebum, at least a half stated themselves to be of this
class.&nbsp; These, although of illegitimate extraction, are not
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>called Khas; but, until the present dynasty seized on
the government, were considered as entitled to all the immunities
and privileges of the sacred order, as were also the children of
Brahmans by widows of their own rank.</p>
<p>The descendants of Brahmans by women of the lower tribes,
although admitted to be Khas, or impure, are called Kshatris or
Khatris, which terms are considered as perfectly synonymous, and
have now formed two tribes, Pauriyal and Sili; but some proper
Khatris, called Dewkotas and Lahauriyas, from Bareli and Lahaur,
have settled in the country, and intermarry with the Pauriyal and
Sili, all of whom wear the thread, and are considered as
belonging to the military tribes.</p>
<p>The Rajputs that are, or that even pretend to be, descended of
the colony which came from Chitaur, are very few in number; but
the families of the mountain chiefs, who have adopted the Hindu
rules of purity, and even some who have neglected to do so, are
now universally admitted to be Rajputs; and the Chitaur family
have so often married the daughters of the former, that several
members of it have acquired the Tartar countenance, while some of
the mountain families, by intermarriages with pure but indigent
Rajputs, have acquired oval faces and high noses.&nbsp; Not only
the colony, therefore, from Chitaur, if the Palpa family be such,
but all the descendants of the hill chiefs, are now called
Rajputs; and, until the absorption of all power in the Gorkha
family, the Rajputs held all the principal civil and military
offices of the petty states into which the country was
subdivided.&nbsp; It would also appear, that, when the princes of
the mountaineers were persuaded to follow the doctrines of the
Brahmans, many of their subjects or clans were induced to follow
the example of their chiefs, and thus have established tribes
called Thapas, Ghartis, Karkis, Majhis, Basnats, Bishtakos,
Ranas, and Kharkas, all <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of whom are called Khasiyas, or
natives of Khas, but they wear the thread, and live pure like
Kshatris, and, in fact, are included among the fencibles or
military power of the country, and are very much employed in the
government of the family of Gorkha, under which some of them
enjoy the highest dignities of the state; for Bhim Sen, who is
now vested with the whole power of the kingdom, is by birth a
Thapa, as is also Amar Singha Karyi, who commands the army beyond
the Yamuna.&nbsp; Among those called Khasiyas, thus adopted into
the military order, there may be many others, of which I did not
hear; but it would not appear, even when they adopted fully the
rules of purity, that the whole of these tribes obtained so
elevated a rank, which is almost equal to that of the sacred
bastards.&nbsp; The Thapas, for instance, are of two kinds, Khas
and Ranggu; yet the latter, although they live pure, and have
pure Brahmans to give them instruction, and to perform their
ceremonies, are not permitted to wear the military badge, nor to
intermarry with those who enjoy this privilege.&nbsp; The
Ghartis, also, are of two kinds, Khas and Bhujal.&nbsp; The
former are admitted to the military dignity; but the latter
wallow in all the abominations of the impure Gurungs, and do not
speak the Khas language.&nbsp; The Ranas, also, are divided into
two kinds, the Khas and Magar.&nbsp; The latter are a branch of
the Magar tribe, and totally neglect the rules of Hindu
purity.&nbsp; It is not even, as I have said, all the Rajputs
that have adopted the rules of purity, and some branches of the
same families were pure, while others rejected the advice of the
sacred order, and eat and drank whatever their appetites
craved.</p>
<p>All these military tribes, including the Khasiyas, descended
of Brahmans or Khatris, who are more numerous than all the
others, the Rajputs, Thapas, etc. have again had children by
widows of their own cast, and by concubines of lower tribes, and
these <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>children are also called Khasiyas,
who, although they live equally pure, and observe equally the
laws of the Brahmans, are not permitted to wear the thread of
distinction; but must toil in ignoble professions.&nbsp; They are
considered as of so little consequence, that, of whatever descent
they may be by the male line, they may all freely
intermarry.&nbsp; They speak the Khas language.</p>
<p>The low tribes, which also speak this language, are all
supposed to form part of the colony from Chitaur; but here there
is a considerable number of a tribe called Khawas, who are
slaves, and accompanied the chief as his domestic servants,
having been in slavery at Chitaur.&nbsp; They are reckoned a pure
tribe, and their women are not abandoned to prostitution like the
slaves of the mountain tribes called Ketis.&nbsp; The Khawas
adhered to the chiefs of the Chitaur family, and were employed in
confidential offices, such as stewards; while these chiefs soon
indulged in the luxury of having mountain slaves round their
persons.&nbsp; Next in rank, in the following order, are,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Nai, or barbers.&nbsp; A Brahman may drink their
water.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Karmi, who build and thatch houses, and Chunra, or
carpenters.&nbsp; These have degraded Brahmans as
instructors.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Kami, miners and workers in iron and copper; Sarki,
tanners and shoemakers; Damai, tailors and musicians.&nbsp; All
these are vile, and have no priests but of their own cast.&nbsp;
Any Musulman or Christian, however, who should cohabit with a
Damai woman, would suffer death, and the woman would be severely
punished; but, according to the Hindu law, a female, however low
in rank, cannot for any crime be deprived of life.&nbsp; When any
woman has been discovered with a Musulman, the whole kingdom is
thrown into confusion.&nbsp; Even if she has been of the lowest
cast, she may have given water to some person of the cast
immediately above her own.&nbsp; He may again <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>have given it
to a higher, and thus the whole inhabitants may have been
involved in sin and disgrace.&nbsp; This can only be expiated by
a ceremony called Prayaschitta, in which the prince washes in the
river with great ceremony, and bestows large sums on the
Brahmans, who read the expiatory prayers proper on the
occasion.&nbsp; The expense of an expiation of this kind, which
was performed during our stay in this country, was, by my
Brahman, estimated at two thousand rupees; but the natives
alleged that it amounted to ten times this sum.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a> mentions the
Dhewars as husbandmen and fishers of the western district, from
which circumstance we may conclude that they belong to the Hindu
colony; but I did not hear of them, as my account of the
Parbatiya tribes was chiefly derived from the central
parts.&nbsp; From the condition of similar tribes on the plains,
these Dhewars probably belong to the third of the ranks above
enumerated, although the Majhis, (Mhanjhees,) whom Colonel
Kirkpatrick joins with the Dhewars, were represented to me as a
tribe of original Khas, which has been converted by the Hindus,
and admitted into the military order.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick then states, <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a> &ldquo;That
Nepaul, having been ruled for many centuries past by Rajput
princes, and the various classes of Hindus appearing in all
periods to have composed a great proportion of its population, we
are naturally prepared to find a general resemblance in manners
and customs between this part of its inhabitants, and kindred
sects established in adjacent countries; accordingly, the
differences are so faint as to be scarcely discernible in a
single instance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, I must here observe, that
Nepal, in the proper sense of the word, when Colonel <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Kirkpatrick wrote, had not been governed for half a
century by chiefs, who even pretended to be descended of a Hindu
colony, for the Rajas of Nepal were Newars, who deny this
extraction.&nbsp; They indeed called themselves Rajputs, that is,
the descendants of princes, but so does the king of Ava, although
no one ever imagined that he is descended of the Rajputs in
Hindustan.&nbsp; I shall afterwards have occasion to show, that
the various classes of Hindus, that is, of the natives of India,
who have adopted the Brahmans for spiritual guides, have not in
all periods composed a great proportion of the population, nor
have even entered any part of the country as residents.&nbsp; At
present, indeed, in most parts of the kingdom, except in Nepal
itself, they, or converts to their doctrine, form a large
proportion of the inhabitants; and the more recent the
importation, I should expect the greater resemblance between the
colonists and the inhabitants of the plains of India; but, in
fact, the resemblance, though strong, is not so complete as
Colonel Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s short stay amongst them induced him
to suppose, as will appear from what I shall afterwards
state.</p>
<p>These mountain Hindus appear to me a deceitful and treacherous
people, cruel and arrogant towards those in their power, and
abjectly mean towards those from whom they expect favour.&nbsp;
Their men of rank, even of the sacred order, pass their nights in
the company of male and female dancers and musicians, and, by an
excessive indulgence in pleasure, are soon exhausted.&nbsp; Their
mornings are passed in sleep, and the day is occupied by the
performance of religious ceremonies, so that little time remains
for business, or for storing their minds with useful
knowledge.&nbsp; Except a few of the Brahmans, they are, in
general, drunkards, which, joined to a temper uncommonly
suspicious, and to a consciousness of having neglected the
conjugal duties, works them up to a fury of <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>jealousy that
frequently produces assassination.&nbsp; For this they are all
prepared, by wearing a large knife in their girdle, and the point
of honour requires them never to rest, until they have shed the
blood of the man who has been suspected of a criminal intercourse
with their wives.&nbsp; The jealous man watches his opportunity
for months, and even for years, should his adversary be on his
guard; and, having at length found a favourable time, with one
stroke of his knife in the throat of his rival, he satisfies his
revenge.&nbsp; This is considered as so commendable, that, at
Kathmandu, the police, in other respects very strict, does not at
all interfere, although the murderer is often actuated merely by
suspicion.</p>
<p>The higher ranks, whenever not compelled by the most urgent
necessity, conceal their women; and their widows ought to burn
themselves with their husbands&rsquo; corpse.&nbsp; Many,
however, refuse, nor did I learn that force is ever used.&nbsp;
The custom seems, however, more prevalent than in any part of
India where I have been, the vicinity of Calcutta excepted.</p>
<p>The appearance and dress of the lower orders of these
Parbatiya Hindus is represented in the plate opposite to page 40
of Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Nepaul, where the figure, behind those
seated, is a porter of this tribe.</p>
<p>In these eastern parts of the dominions of Nepal, the mountain
Hindus are far from having extirpated the aboriginal tribes, most
of which, until the accession of the Gorkha family, enjoyed their
customs and religion with little or no disturbance, and they are
still numerous and powerful, as will be afterwards mentioned;
but, west from the Kali river, there is a great difference.&nbsp;
The whole people in Kumau, and Garhawal at least, as well as
their language, are called Khasiyas, as having settled in the
Khas country; but all pretend to be descended of colonists from
the south, and disclaim every connection with the <!-- page

24</span>original impure barbarians.&nbsp; West from Garhawal,
the term Khas is altogether rejected, and it is pretended that
this impure race never held the country.&nbsp; Each cast, west
from the Kali, preserves its race with the utmost care; nor are
widows of the high cast permitted to become concubines.&nbsp;
Except in a very few places, near the passes through the snowy
mountains, the aboriginal inhabitants are alleged to have been
obliged entirely to conform to the rules of Hindu purity, and to
reject their ancient forms of worship; for I hope that the
colonists from the south are not so bad as they pretend, and that
religious zeal has not had such a victory over humanity as they
allege; for the fear of being thought in any degree contaminated
by the infidel Khas, would make them carefully conceal whatever
indulgence humanity may have wrung from intolerance.&nbsp; To
such a height is caution on this subject required, that the
people, who have settled near the passes in the snowy mountains,
although acknowledged as of the same tribes with those nearer the
plain, and although they use the same language and manners, are
called Bhotiyas, and are no longer permitted to intermarry with
the people who can have no intercourse with these impure
infidels.&nbsp; On account of this strictness, the Rajputs of the
western districts are as much courted by those of the plains, as
those east from the Kali are scouted.</p>
<p>The mountain tribes, which I consider aboriginal, as I have
said, have Chinese or Tartar faces, but each spoke a peculiar
language.&nbsp; Some used a written character altered from the
Nagri, so as to enable it to express their utterance; others had
not the use of letters.&nbsp; Before the arrival of Hindu
colonies, they had no idea of cast; but some of the tribes
confined their marriages to their own nation, while others
admitted of intermarriages with strangers.&nbsp; The women in all
seem to enjoy great <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>indulgence, and are allowed, as in
Europe, to form a choice for themselves, after they have arrived
at mature years.</p>
<p>In all these hill tribes the women were weavers, and seem to
have enjoyed great privileges; but the plurality of husbands had
not been introduced with the religion of Thibet.&nbsp; Until the
arrival of the Rajputs, they seem all to have eaten every kind of
animal food, and still do so whenever they are at liberty to
indulge their inclinations.&nbsp; They still continue to drink
spirituous liquors.&nbsp; Each tribe appears originally to have
had a priesthood and deities peculiar to itself, although the
worship of Bhim Sen, the son of Pandu, seems to be very general,
and to have been that which preceded the doctrine of the Buddhas;
but first the Lamas, or, perhaps, rather the Zogis, and then the
Brahmans, have made encroachments, and at the same time
introduced many new customs.&nbsp; They have not yet introduced
the custom of inoculation for the small-pox, and those who are
seized are put into a separate hut, to which the friends daily
convey water and food, but do not enter; and the sick is allowed
to take his chance.&nbsp; They are all very slovenly and
dirty.</p>
<p>The tribes, which, on the arrival of the colonies from
Hindustan, occupied the country east from the Kali river, (for
those to the west have been extirpated or abolished,) were
chiefly Magars, Gurungs, Jariyas, Newars, Murmis, Kirats, Limbus,
Lapchas, and Bhotiyas.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> mentions also people called
Nuggerkoties and Hawoos, of whom I have not heard.&nbsp; All
these tribes he calls Hindus of the meanest cast; but on what
foundation, unless that they are Pagans, and neither Christians
nor Muhammedans, I do not know.</p>
<p>The Magars, called Mungurs by Colonel Kirkpatrick, occupied a
great proportion of the lower hills in the western parts, <!--
page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>seem to have received the Rajput chiefs with much
cordiality, and have now adopted a great part of the ferocious
customs of these mountain Hindus.&nbsp; They eat copiously the
flesh of hogs, goats, sheep, ducks, and fowls, but now abstain
from beef.&nbsp; They are much addicted to intoxication, and are
excessively cruel and treacherous; but they are men of great
bodily vigour and mental activity.&nbsp; They have, in general,
submitted to the guidance of the same Brahmans and Sannyasis that
instruct the Rajputs; but formerly had priests of their own tribe
called Damis, and seemed to have worshipped chiefly ghosts.&nbsp;
They marry only one wife.</p>
<p>The family of Gorkha which now governs Nepal, although it
pretends to come from Chitaur, according to Sadu Ram, a good
authority, is, in reality, of the Magar tribe; and, at any rate,
these people are now firmly attached to its interests, by having
largely shared in the sweets of conquest; and by far the greatest
part of the regular troops of that family is composed of this
nation.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a> has given a short
vocabulary of its language, which has no affinity to the
Parbatiya or Sangskrita.&nbsp; In the vocabulary which I have
deposited in the Company&rsquo;s library, will be seen a more
full specimen of the Magar language, which now, at least, is
written in the Nagri character.&nbsp; By many of the soldiery,
owing to their frequent absence from home, for the purpose of
attending at court, it has been entirely forgotten.&nbsp; In a
short time, therefore, it is highly probable that this people may
unite with the mountain Hindus, and be considered as one of their
casts.&nbsp; When I was at Kathmandu, indeed, I found that many
people were then of this opinion; and Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>includes them
among the Kshatriya or military cast.&nbsp; But hitherto the
tribe has been so powerful, that many people in the west speak
its language although they do not belong to it; and by far the
greatest number adhere to the original impurity of life which
their ancestors embraced.&nbsp; Before the arrival of the
Rajputs, it is said, that this nation consisted of twelve Thums,
or clans, the whole members of each being supposed to have a
common extraction in the male line; and a man and woman of the
same blood could not intermarry.&nbsp; Each Thum was governed by
a chief, considered as the head of a common family.</p>
<p>Near the Magars was settled a numerous tribe named Gurung,
whose wealth chiefly consisted in sheep, but whose manners are,
in most respects, nearly the same with those of the Magars,
except that, in the course of their pastoral life, they frequent
the Alpine regions in summer, and return to the valleys in
winter.&nbsp; The men also employ themselves in weaving blankets;
but they are a tribe addicted to arms.&nbsp; A chief who
pretended to be of the Hindu colony, and who was Raja of Kaski,
having either settled where these Gurungs were the most
predominant tribe, in the districts of Gangrong Postong and
Argong, or being, in fact, of the Gurung tribe,&mdash;these
people were strongly attached to his descendants, by whom they
were not disturbed in their religious opinions or customs, and
they continued to follow the doctrines of Sakya, as explained to
them by Lamas of their own tribe, who were supposed qualified to
give them instruction, and to direct their ceremonies.&nbsp;
These persons are said never to have given themselves the trouble
of studying the language of Thibet, and, therefore, were probably
not very conversant in the doctrines of Sakya, which they
professed to teach.&nbsp; The Gurungs remain in these parts in
great numbers, and still adhere to the Lamas; nor do I hear that
any of them have been admitted to the dignity of <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Khasiya, although perhaps the Ghartis, above mentioned
as belonging to that class of Hindus, may be of this race, as one
part of the Ghartis, that still remains impure, is said to live
among the Gurungs, and to have similar manners.&nbsp; There are,
at any rate, several tribes of Gurungs, such as Nisi, Bhuji,
Ghali, and Thagsi.&nbsp; The latter live nearest the snow; but
all the Gurungs require a cold climate, and live much intermixed
with the Bhotiyas on both sides of the snow-covered peaks of
Emodus, and in the narrow valleys interposed, which, in the
language of the country, are called Langna.&nbsp; The Gurungs
cultivate with the hoe, and are diligent traders and
miners.&nbsp; They convey their goods on sheep, of which they
have numerous flocks.</p>
<p>The Jariyas formed a very numerous tribe, occupying much of
the lower hilly region between the Kali and Nepal Proper, south
from the Gurungs, and intermixed with the Magars.&nbsp; There can
be little doubt that the Malebum family was of the Jariya tribe;
but one of the chiefs having an only daughter, gave her in
marriage to a Brahman, and from this source spring the families
of Malebum, and its numerous collateral branches, with a large
proportion of the Rajputs of this part of the country; although,
where not of a chief&rsquo;s family, the offspring of a Brahman
by a Sudra is reckoned a Khasiya.&nbsp; I have not heard that any
of the Jariyas continue to be viewed as impure; and I think it
probable, that they have all obtained the rank of Khas, although
it is generally admitted, that they had a dialect peculiar to
themselves; but of this I could procure no specimen.</p>
<p>The Khas Ranas, there is no doubt, were originally Magars; but
whether the Thapas, Karkis, Majhis, Basnats, Bishtakos, and
Kharkas, all now considered as Hindus of the Khas tribe, were
branches of the Magar race, or Jariyas, or Gurungs, I cannot take
upon myself to say.&nbsp; I can only observe, that, in <!-- page
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>this
vicinity, I heard of no tribes but the Magars, Jariyas, and
Gurungs, that spoke languages different from the Khas, and that
there is no reason to suppose the Thapas, etc. to have come from
Chitaur; although, on adopting the religion and laws of that
country, they have also adopted its language, but many of them
still speak the Magar tongue.</p>
<p>The more fertile part of what is called Nepal Proper, was
chiefly occupied by the Newars, a race addicted to agriculture
and commerce, and far more advanced in the arts than any other of
the mountain tribes.&nbsp; Their style of building, and most of
their other arts, appear to have been introduced from Thibet, and
the greater part still adhere to the tenets of the Buddhs; but
they have adopted the doctrine of cast, have rejected the Lamas,
and have a priesthood of their own called Bangras.&nbsp; Their
own chiefs, of a family called by the common title of Mal, at the
time when conquered by the Raja of Gorkha, had divided into three
branches, governing Kathmandu, Lalita-Patan, and Bhatgang.&nbsp;
During the government of these chiefs a good many of the Newars
had rejected the doctrine of Sakya, and adopted the worship of
Siva, but without changing their manners, which are chiefly
remarkable for a most extraordinary carelessness about the
conduct of their women; neither have they adopted the Brahmans as
their priests.&nbsp; Some of themselves, with the title of Achar,
have assumed the manners and authority of the sacred order.</p>
<p>Thus the Newars, in point of religion, are divided into two
sects.&nbsp; A very small portion has forsaken the doctrine of
Buddha, while by far the most numerous class adhere to the
doctrines taught by Sakya Singha.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a> seems to think, that
the worshippers <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of Buddha among the Newars, whom he
calls Bahauras, (Bangras,) are only a trifling portion,
&ldquo;who have apostatized in a certain degree from the
religious creed of their countrymen at some period subsequent to
their conquest of Nepaul, or, at least, to have grafted upon it a
considerable portion of the idolatry of Thibet.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
this had been the case, we should have found the greater part of
the Newars adhering to the Brahmans, which is not the case; and
the portion which has adopted the doctrine of the Vedas,
rejecting the sacred order of the Hindus, have the Achars as
priests of their own.&nbsp; The probable cause of Colonel
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s supposing the followers of Buddha among the
Newars to be small in number is explained by another passage, <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a> where the Bangras are called Bhanras,
and are stated to be a sort of separatists from the Newars, and
to amount to about 5000.&nbsp; He does not seem to have been
aware, that these were merely the priests of this sect, and that
such a number in the priesthood implies a very large proportion
of the sect.</p>
<p>The worshippers of Siva among the Newars in their religious
opinions follow the doctrine of the Vedas, as explained by
Sankara Acharya; but they do not receive the Brahmans as their
Gurus, or instructors, and in spirituals are subordinate to a
class of Newars, who are called Achars or Doctors, who are both
their instructors (Gurus) and priests, (Purohits,) and who differ
in birth and name only from the Brahmans.</p>
<p>Among the Sivamarg Newars, or those who worship Maha Deva, the
Achars are considered as the highest cast; but their superiority
is not acknowledged by those who worship Bouddha.&nbsp; They
officiate as priests (Pujaris) in the temples of Siva and of the
Saktis, and read the prayers (Mantras) that are <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>appointed to
accompany sacrifices; but they do not kill the animal that is
offered.&nbsp; The Achars have among them certain men who perform
the ceremonies necessary to free from sin the souls of those who
die on certain unfortunate days.&nbsp; This ceremony they call
Hom.&nbsp; The Brahmans perform similar rites, which they call
Pushkarasanti.&nbsp; The Hindus believe, that if this ceremony is
neglected, all the relations of the deceased will perish.&nbsp;
By this ceremony the officiating priest is supposed to take upon
himself the sin of the departed soul; and if, in its performance,
he commits any mistake, he incurs certain destruction from the
wrath of the Deity.&nbsp; The office is therefore shunned by men
of high rank, both as sinful and dangerous.&nbsp; The Achars who
perform this ceremony are called Gulcul, and cannot intermarry
with those of the first rank.&nbsp; This inferior order performs
also any ceremonies that may be wanted by Newars, who are at a
distance from home, and the purity of whose extraction cannot
therefore be ascertained.&nbsp; Poor Achars cultivate the land
with their own hands, from which they are not deterred by a fear
of distressing the ox, as the plough is not used by the
Newars.&nbsp; Their women spin and weave, which is the only point
in which they seem to differ from the Brahmans; the two casts,
however, consider themselves as entirely distinct.</p>
<p>Among the Newars, the Bangras, or Baryesu, are the head of the
sect of Buddhmargas, and are much more numerous than the
Achars.&nbsp; They are divided into two classes.&nbsp; The first
are the Gubal Bangras, who are the instructors, (Gurus,) priests,
(Purohits,) and philosophers, (Pandits,) of all the sect, and are
priests (Pujaris) at the temples of Buddh, and of some of the
Saktis.&nbsp; When they perform any ceremony, they wear a thread
like the Brahmans or Achars.&nbsp; They neither eat nor
intermarry with any person of inferior rank.&nbsp; The Bakali
Bangras <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>work in gold, silver, and copper, and
are traders and cultivators.&nbsp; We may thus observe, that the
doctrine of cast, and the nature of the priesthood, are essential
differences between the religion of the Burmas and that professed
by the followers of Buddh in Nepal.&nbsp; The doctrines of these
people appeared so shockingly impious to my Brahman, that I could
not induce him to converse on the subject with their learned
men.&nbsp; These doctrines also are essentially different from
those taught by the Rahans, or priests of Ava.&nbsp; The Bangras
believe in a supreme being, called Sambhu, or Swayambhu, from
whom have proceeded many Buddhs, or Intelligences, which, by the
Tartars, are called Bourkans.&nbsp; Among these Matsyendranath
has the chief superintendence over the affairs of the
world.&nbsp; Under him are a great many Devatas, or spirits of
vast power, among whom Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver,
and Siva the destroyer of this earth, do not bear a very
distinguished rank.&nbsp; These spirits are the Tengri of the
Tartars, and the Nat of the Burmas, of which the worship is
execrated by the followers of Buddha in Ava; but is eagerly
followed by most of the Bangras, and still more so by the lower
casts of Newars.&nbsp; Sakya Singha is considered one of the
Buddhs, who came on earth to instruct man in the true worship,
and in Nepal is commonly believed to be still alive at
Lasa.&nbsp; His images entirely resemble those of Gautama.&nbsp;
As this teacher has admitted the worship of all the Nat, or
Devatas, among whom are placed the deities worshipped by the
followers of the Vedas, we can readily account for the appearance
of these in the temples of the Chinese.&nbsp; The followers of
Buddh in Ava reject altogether the worship of these beings, so
that, when I was in that country, and was unacquainted with the
doctrines of any other sect of Buddhists, I was led into an
erroneous opinion concerning the religion of the Chinese, from
knowing that they worshipped the <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>same Gods
with the Brahmans.&nbsp; This, we see, is allowed by the doctrine
of Sakya Singha, nor, on account of finding the images of Vishnu,
Siva, or Brahma, in any temple, can we conclude, that it was not
built by a follower of Buddh.&nbsp; In fact, even in
Swayambhunath, the temple of the supreme deity of the Buddhists,
there are a great many images of Siva.</p>
<p>A kind of mixed breed of Newars are, by the Sivamargas,
acknowledged as of very high rank.&nbsp; I shall, therefore,
mention them in this place, although their pretensions are
disputed by the Bangras.&nbsp; They are called Jausi, and are the
only cast that ought to practise medicine; but at present all
ranks profess that art.&nbsp; The Jausis are descended from the
offspring of a Brahman by a Newar woman; and if their mother has
been a Bangra, or an Achar, they wear the thread, and act as
instructors (Gurus) and priests (Purohits) for their brethren of
mixed descent.&nbsp; These privileges are not allowed to such as
are descended from low mothers.&nbsp; In imitation of their
fathers, the Jausis are mostly Sivamargas; but in other matters,
they follow the customs of the Newars.</p>
<p>The next in rank among the Newars are the Srishtas, who form a
small cast.&nbsp; They can serve as cooks for all Newars, the
Achars and Bangras excepted, which is a sure mark of their
transcendent rank.&nbsp; The Buddhmargas and Sivamargas of this
cast eat together; but a woman, for her first paramour, always
chooses a person of her own persuasion.&nbsp; The highest rank of
Srishtas are called Sira, and are mostly traders.&nbsp; A lower
class, called Sual, act as porters; and a still lower, called
Bagul, cultivate the ground.&nbsp; All these eat together; nor is
the difference of class any restriction in their amours.</p>
<p>The persons of the remaining casts are almost entirely
Buddhmargas; but, being low and ignorant, they will worship
almost any thing that is called a God, which is, indeed, usual
with all <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Hindus of their rank.&nbsp; Some of
our Seapoys, who were Brahmans, immediately on our arrival at
Swayambhunath, took flowers and consecrated water, and went round
the hill offering some to every image which they saw, and, among
others, to that of Sakya Singha.&nbsp; I happened to be standing
near it with Ramajaya, my Brahman, who asked them if they knew
what they were doing, and informed them that they were
worshipping Buddh.&nbsp; At this the poor fellows were much
ashamed.&nbsp; However, an old Havildar (serjeant) comforted
them, by observing, that, on the march to Bombay, under General
Goddard, they had often seen this deity, and that their
worshipping him seemed to have been very lucky, as the army had
great success.</p>
<p>I shall enumerate the lower casts, according to their
respective dignities.</p>
<p>The Jopu Newars were originally all cultivators; but some of
them have now become traders and porters.</p>
<p>The Uda were all originally traders, and are nearly of the
same rank with the Jopus.</p>
<p>The Bhat procure a living by proclaiming the titles of great
men, and singing their praises on all public occasions,&mdash;a
vanity in which the men of power in India take great
delight.&nbsp; The Bhat also beg in the name of the Gods, which,
among the Hindus, is always a profession of some dignity.</p>
<p>The three next casts, Got, Kurmi, and Now, are nearly of the
same rank.</p>
<p>The Got are gardeners, and one of them, named Balabhadra, whom
I employed as a collector of plants, repeatedly told me the
following curious circumstances: He said that the Got do not
acknowledge the Achars, or Bangras, as their instructors,
(Gurus,) but have certain persons of their own cast, who, among
their brethren, enjoy this privilege.&nbsp; At certain temples
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>dedicated to Bhawani, which word means merely the
Goddess, the Got attend to dance in masks; and, on these
occasions, ten of them represent Singhini, Vyaghrini, Indrani,
Bhairavi, Bhawani, Varahi, Vaishnavi, Kumari, Brahmani, and
Ganesa, while four others represent Mahakal, Nandiswar,
Vindhyiswar, and Nasadeva, who are the instructors (Gurus) of the
other ten deities.&nbsp; From those who come to worship at the
temple, the Got that represent these deities accept of spirituous
liquors, which they drink out of human skulls till they become
elevated, and dance in a furious manner, which is supposed to
proceed from inspiration.&nbsp; In the same manner, they drink
the blood of the animals which are offered as sacrifices.&nbsp;
In these temples the priests (Pujaris) are Achars, who at the
sacrifices read the forms of prayer (Mantras) proper for the
occasion, but retire when the animal is about to be killed by the
Got who represents Bhairavi.&nbsp; The shrine, in which the
images of the gods are kept, is always shut, and no person is
allowed to enter but the priest (Pujari) and the Gots, who
personate in masks these deities.&nbsp; Once in twelve years the
Raja offers a solemn sacrifice.&nbsp; It consists of two men, of
such a rank that they wear a thread; of two buffaloes, two goats,
two rams, two cocks, two ducks, and two fishes.&nbsp; The lower
animals are first sacrificed in the outer part of the temple, and
in the presence of the multitude their blood is drank by the
masked Gots.&nbsp; After this, the human victims are intoxicated,
and carried into the shrine, where the mask representing Bhairavi
cuts their throats, and sprinkles their blood on the idols.&nbsp;
Their skulls are then formed into cups, which serve the masks for
drinking in their horrid rites.&nbsp; I questioned the man
repeatedly on the subject, and he always related the
circumstances without variation, and declared, that at the last
sacrifice, which had been offered nine years previous to our
arrival <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>in Nepal, he had represented
Bhairavi, and with his own hands had cut the throats of the human
victims.&nbsp; My Brahman, however, inquired of several persons,
who ought to have known the truth, and who denied altogether the
human sacrifices at this ceremony, which is performed in the
Ashtami in the month Aswin.&nbsp; All ranks of the natives of
Nepal pay so very little attention to the observance of veracity,
that I remain in suspense concerning this circumstance.&nbsp;
Balabhadra was a mild attentive creature; and although he spoke
of the human sacrifice with considerable glee, as being attended
with copious potations of spirituous liquor, he was shocked when
I asked him if two bulls made a part of the offering.</p>
<p>The Karmi are bricklayers and carpenters.</p>
<p>The Nau are barbers.</p>
<p>Next follow three casts of nearly the same rank.</p>
<p>Songat, or washermen.</p>
<p>Japu, or potmakers.</p>
<p>Hial, or Sial, who are cow-herds.</p>
<p>Nearly of the same rank are the persons, by the Newars called
Dhui, but whom the Parbatiyas call Putaul.&nbsp; They are the
persons who carry the palanquins of the Raja, and of his
family.&nbsp; None but Bakali Bangras will condescend to act as
instructors (Gurus) for a cast so low as this is.</p>
<p>All the casts yet enumerated are considered as pure, and
Hindus of any rank may drink the water which they have drawn from
a well; but the following casts are impure, and a person of any
considerable dignity will be defiled by their touch.</p>
<p>The Salim are oil-makers, and weavers of garlands, at which
art the Newars are very dexterous, and there is a great demand
for their work, as both sexes, of all ranks in Nepal, ornament
their hair with flowers.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>The Kasulia are musicians, and have a vast variety of
ear-rending instruments.&nbsp; The Hindu music, especially that
of the martial kind, is said by the natives to be in great
perfection in Nepal; and in this holy land are still to be found
all the kinds that were to be found in the army of Rama.</p>
<p>Still lower than these are the Kasai, who are butchers, and
palanquin bearers for the vulgar.&nbsp; The Chhipi, or dyers, are
nearly of the same rank.</p>
<p>Lower again are the two following casts.</p>
<p>Kow, or ironsmiths.</p>
<p>Gotoo, or coppersmiths.</p>
<p>Then follow two military tribes.</p>
<p>Kosar, who are said originally to have been robbers.</p>
<p>Tepai, who can marry, or keep as concubines any Hindu women
that have lost cast by eating unclean things.</p>
<p>Then follow three exceedingly low casts.</p>
<p>Puria, fishermen and basketmakers.</p>
<p>Bala, who remove offals and nastiness.</p>
<p>Chamkal, who are dressers of leather and shoemakers.</p>
<p>These casts can scarcely venture to draw near any other Hindu,
but would consider themselves as much degraded, by eating,
drinking, or cohabiting with a Musulman or Christian; and any of
their women who should venture to commit an act of such
uncleanness, would be severely punished, as would also be the
infidel by whom she had been corrupted.&nbsp; This, however, does
not prevent Hindu women of all ranks and casts from being sold as
slaves to either Musulmans or Christians.&nbsp; A master or a
parent has the power of selling his slave or child, whose consent
is not asked, who thereby loses cast, and who has no alternative,
but to adopt the religion of her new master.&nbsp; Such
incongruities may astonish a person unacquainted with Hindus; and
what may add to his surprise is, that, while at <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Kathmandu,
several Hindus, of high cast, among our followers, chose to
embrace the Musulman faith, and thereby subjected themselves to
severe restrictions and disgrace.</p>
<p>Musulmans have become pretty numerous, and are increasing, as
they are zealous in purchasing girls, and in propagating their
sect.&nbsp; Christianity has not been equally successful; and, on
our arrival, we found the church reduced to an Italian Padre, and
a native Portuguese, who had been inveigled from Patna by large
promises, which were not made good, and who would have been happy
to have been permitted to leave the country.</p>
<p>These are the various casts of Newars.&nbsp; I shall now give
an account of the customs that are common to the whole
nation.</p>
<p>All the Newars burn the dead; all eat buffaloes, sheep, goats,
fowls, and ducks; and all drink spirituous liquors, to the use of
which, indeed, they are excessively addicted.&nbsp; The highest
of the Sivamargas kill animals with their own hands; but the
higher orders of the Buddhmargs abstain from shedding blood, and
from eating pork.&nbsp; They all live in towns or villages, and
their houses are built of brick with clay mortar, and covered
with tiles.&nbsp; These houses are three stories high, the ground
floor being appropriated for the cattle and poultry, the second
floor for servants, and the third for the family of the
owner.&nbsp; This is in the houses of the wealthy.&nbsp; Among
the poor, a number of families live under one roof.&nbsp; The
rooms are exceeding low, as I could not stand upright in the
principal apartment of what was reckoned the best house in
Kathmandu, the palace excepted.&nbsp; At first sight, however,
the houses look well, especially to a person coming from the
towns of Hindustan.&nbsp; In Nepal, they have numerous large
windows, which are shut by wooden lattices curiously carved, and
which, <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>in some measure, hang over the
street, the upper end of the lattice projecting much more than
the lower.&nbsp; Within, the houses are exceedingly mean and
dirty, and swarm with vermin, which, added to all manner of
filth, including the offals of the shambles, and the blood of
sacrifices, that is allowed to corrupt in the streets, renders an
abode in any of their towns utterly disgusting.</p>
<p>The following account of the Nepalese, or rather Newar,
architecture, I have taken from papers communicated by Colonel
Crawford.</p>
<p>The Nepalese possess a great advantage in having an excellent
clay for making bricks and tiles; and their workmen are very
expert.&nbsp; They use moulds nearly of the size and shape of our
common bricks, and have also others for the bricks that are used
in cornices and other ornaments.&nbsp; For the fronts and
ornamental parts of their best houses, they make smooth glazed
bricks, that are very handsome.&nbsp; Their bricklayers and
masons are also good workmen, but labour under a great
disadvantage, the want of lime.&nbsp; The tiles are flat, of an
oblong form, and have two longitudinal grooves, one above and
another below, which fit into the adjacent tiles, and the whole
are put on with great neatness.</p>
<p>The houses of towns are in general three stories high, though
some in the cities and large towns rise to four.&nbsp; The lower
story has no windows, and the smoke of their kitchens comes out
by the door, which renders the outside, even of their houses,
very black and dirty.&nbsp; The windows of the second story are
always small and nearly square.&nbsp; In each, a wooden trellis,
which is highly ornamented by carving, but which cannot be opened
and shut, admits the air and light, but prevents strangers from
seeing into the apartment.&nbsp; The <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>third or
upper story has large windows, extending a great part of the
length of each sitting apartment.&nbsp; Most of these windows
have in front a wooden balcony composed of lattice work, in
general much carved.&nbsp; This slopes outwards from a bench that
is a little elevated from the floor, and joins the edge of the
roof, which projects considerably beyond the wall.&nbsp; The
bench is the favourite seat of the people, who, from thence,
command a view of the street.&nbsp; The rooms are always narrow,
the difficulty of carrying large timber from the mountains,
per-venting them from procuring beams of sufficient
dimensions.&nbsp; The beams, which can be usually procured, are
fir of about six inches square.&nbsp; These are placed at about a
foot distant from each other, and their ends project beyond the
walls, so that from the street you can tell the number of beams
in each house.&nbsp; The larger houses are square, with an open
court in the centre.</p>
<p>In the villages, the houses are built of unburnt bricks, and
often also consist of three stories disposed of in the same
manner as in towns; but the windows of the upper story are not
provided with balconies.&nbsp; Those of two stories are also very
common, and one of them is represented by Colonel Kirkpatrick in
the plate opposite to page 160.</p>
<p>The temples are of two kinds.&nbsp; One, constructed of solid
brick, and peculiar to the worshippers of Buddha, resembles the
temples of the same sect in Ava.&nbsp; The other is common to the
Bouddhists and followers of the Vedas, and has a strong
resemblance to the temples of the Chinese.&nbsp; The temples of
this kind are destined to contain idols, and are squares
consisting of from two to five stories, each of which is of
smaller dimensions than the one below, and the last ends in a
point.&nbsp; Each story has a sloping roof, and in some fine <!--
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>temples, these roofs are covered with gilded
copper.&nbsp; The lower 
<a href="images/p41a.jpg">
<img alt=
"Temple bell"
title=
"Temple bell"
src="images/p41a.jpg" />
</a> story is surrounded by a rude wooden colonnade.&nbsp; From
the corners, and sometimes all round the edges of these roofs,
are suspended small bells with slender clappers, which are
considerably longer than the bells, and end in a thin plate
shaped like the ace of hearts, so that a strong wind occasions
all the bells to ring.&nbsp; The roofs are supported by posts,
which 
<a href="images/p41b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Temple"
title=
"Temple"
src="images/p41b.jpg" />
</a> project from the middle of the upright wall to the edge of
the slope, and are carved with all the distorted figures of Hindu
mythology.&nbsp; In the larger temples, these posts on the second
story are covered with planks, and on these are fastened all the
various offerings that have been made to the Deity, and which
form a strange and ridiculous assemblage of swords and shields,
pots, pans, spinning-wheels, mugs, jars, buffaloes&rsquo; horns,
looking-glasses, knives, bracelets, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The view given by Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"
class="citation">[41a]</a> of Kathmandu affords a good idea of
the place, and shows the strong resemblance of its temples to
those of Thibet and China.&nbsp; I cannot but therefore wonder,
when he says, <a name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a> &ldquo;These edifices appeared to
differ nothing in their figure or construction from <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the
wooden Mundups, occasionally met with in other parts of
India.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have never in India seen any such, either
in structure or in materials, every considerable temple there
being either of brick or stone.</p>
<p>The Newar women are never confined.&nbsp; At eight years of
age, they are carried to a temple, and married, with the
ceremonies usual among Hindus, to a fruit called Bel, (&AElig;gle
Marmelos, Roxb.)&nbsp; When a girl arrives at the age of puberty,
her parents, with her consent, betroth her to some man of the
same cast, and give her a dower, which becomes the property of
the husband, or rather paramour.&nbsp; After this, the nuptials
are celebrated with feasting, and some religious
ceremonies.&nbsp; Among the higher casts, it is required that
girls should be chaste till they have been thus betrothed; but in
the lower casts, a girl, without scandal, may previously indulge
any Hindu with her favours; and this licentiousness is considered
a thing of no consequence.&nbsp; Whenever a woman pleases, she
may leave her husband; and if, during her absence, she cohabit
only with men of her own cast, or of a higher one, she may at any
time return to her husband&rsquo;s house, and resume the command
of his family.&nbsp; The only ceremony or intimation that is
necessary, before she goes away, is her placing two betel-nuts on
her bed.&nbsp; So long as a woman chooses to live with her
husband, he cannot take another wife, until she becomes past
child-bearing; but a man may take a second wife, when his first
chooses to leave him, or when she grows old; and at all times he
may keep as many concubines as he pleases.&nbsp; A widow cannot
marry again; but she is not expected to burn herself; and may
cohabit with any Hindu as a concubine.&nbsp; The children, by the
betrothed wife, have a preference in succession to those by
concubines; the latter, however, are entitled to some
share.&nbsp; A man can be betrothed to no woman <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>except one of
his own cast; but he may keep a concubine of any cast, whose
water he can drink.&nbsp; If the woman&rsquo;s cast be lower than
his, the children are called Khas, and are considered as
belonging to the cast of the mother, but are somewhat elevated on
account of their father&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>A custom of the Newars, which was observed on the 11th of
August by Colonel Crawford, deserves to be mentioned on account
of its oddity.&nbsp; Each man on that day purchases a small
quantity of boiled rice, mashed into a soft substance, and
carries it to the field which he has cultivated.&nbsp; He then
searches the field for frogs, and to every one that he can
discover he gives a small portion of the boiled rice, at the same
time uttering a prayer, and requesting the frog to watch over and
protect his crop.</p>
<p>The Newars are a peaceable people, and not so much addicted to
assassination as the Parbatiyas; but possess all the other vices
of that barbarous race.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation43"></a><a
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a> doubts, whether the
Newars have at any period been a warlike nation; but the long
resistance which they made against Prithwi Narayan appears to me
to indicate abundant courage, while his success seems to have
been more owing to his cunning, and to his taking advantage of
their internal dissensions, than to a superiority in the art of
war.</p>
<p>One vile custom of the Newars of Kathmandu has been described
by Colonel Crawford, from whose papers I have taken the following
account.&nbsp; About the end of May, and beginning of June, for
fifteen days, a skirmish takes place between the young men and
boys, of the north and south ends of the city.&nbsp; During the
first fourteen days it is chiefly <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>confined to
the boys or lads; but on the evening of the fifteenth day it
becomes more serious.&nbsp; The opposing parties are drawn up in
the broad, level, sandy bed of the river, which runs between the
city and Swayambhunath.&nbsp; In the rear of each is a rising
ground, which prevents either party from being hard pushed; for,
the only weapons used being stones, the ascent gives such an
advantage, that the pursuit of the victorious party is usually
checked on their reaching the hill of their adversaries.&nbsp;
The fight begins about an hour before sunset, and continues until
darkness separate the combatants.&nbsp; In the one which we saw,
four people were carried off much wounded, and almost every other
year one or two men are killed: yet the combat is not instigated
by hatred, nor do the accidents that happen occasion any
rancour.&nbsp; Formerly, however, a most cruel practice
existed.&nbsp; If any unfortunate fellow was taken prisoner, he
was immediately dragged to the top of a particular eminence in
the rear of his conquerors, who put him to death with buffalo
bones.&nbsp; In remembrance of this custom, the bones are still
brought to the field, but the barbarous use of them has for many
years been abolished.&nbsp; The prisoners are now kept until the
end of the combat, are carried home in triumph by the victors,
and confined until morning, when they are liberated.</p>
<p>The origin of this custom is attributed to two causes.&nbsp;
Some allege, that at one time Kathmandu was subject to two Rajas,
and that the skirmishings first arose among their respective
followers, and have ever since been continued.&nbsp; Others, with
more probability, think that the combat is meant to commemorate a
battle between a son of Maha Deva, and a Rakshas, or evil
spirit.&nbsp; Colonel Crawford justly gives a preference to this
opinion, for, if one of the parties obtain the victory, every
thing favourable, seasonable rains, plentiful crops, and <!--
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>fine weather, is augured for the remainder of the year;
the reverse is expected should the opposite party gain an
advantage.</p>
<p>The territory anciently called Mithila, comprehending much of
the northern parts of the district of Puraniya, and all those of
Tirahut, belonged for many ages to a dynasty of princes called
Janaka, who resided at Janakipur in the low country subject to
Gorkha.&nbsp; Long afterwards, in that part of the country there
had arisen a dynasty, the seat of whose government was at Gar
Samaran, through the extensive ruins of which, the present
boundary between the Company and the Gorkhalese passes.&nbsp; In
the year 1802, when in this vicinity, I heard an imperfect
account concerning this dynasty, and have mentioned them in the
observations on Nepal, which I then composed.&nbsp; Anxious to
procure more accurate information, in 1810 I sent an intelligent
Brahman to inquire after traditions, who discovered a person
residing at Chotoni, whose ancestors had been registers of
Tirahut, and who gave him the following account.&nbsp; In the
year of the Bengal era 496, (A.D. 1089,) Nanyop Dev, of the
Kshatria tribe, acquired the sovereignty of Tirahut, and was the
founder of a dynasty, the princes of which succeeded from father
to son in the following order.</p>

<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>This person had great power, and is universally
acknowledged to have settled the customs which are now observed
by the Brahmans of Mithila.&nbsp; After his death there was an
interegnum of thirty-four years.&nbsp; The greatest difficulty in
this accession arises from the two enormous reigns of fifty-two
and ninety-two years held in succession by father and son.&nbsp;
It is just possible that a grandfather and grandson might reign
such a number of years, and the minute distinction of grandson
and son may naturally enough have escaped the notice of Hindu
genealogist; but there is reason to suspect, that the accession
of Nanyop dev is antedated, for the same authority states, that
he took possession of Tirahut on the death of Lakshman Sen king
of Bengal, who, it is well known, had conquered it in the 1104th
year of our era, or twenty-five years after the accession given
to Nanyop, and probably governed it for a good many years.&nbsp;
On the death of that warlike prince, it is very likely that
Nanyop may have wrested Tirahut, or the western parts of Mithila,
from his successor, and may have been the Raja of Oriswa, against
whom Lakshmam II. erected the works of Majurni Khata, for the
learned D&rsquo;Anville places Oriswa in these parts.&nbsp; When
the length of these reigns is thus curtailed, the story may be
sufficiently exact.</p>
<p>The account of this dynasty given by Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a> differs considerably from that which I
have above stated.&nbsp; He makes Hari Singha (Hurr Sinha) the
last king of Gar Samaran, and states, that he was driven from
this to Nepal in 1323 by the Patan king Secunder Lodi; but, at
that time, according to Dow&rsquo;s translation of Ferishta, Yeas
ul deen Tuglick Shaw was the Muhammedan king of India; and the
people of Mithila assert, that Hari Singha, their prince, died in
quiet possession of <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>his birthright.&nbsp; The
predecessors of Hari Singha at Gar Samaran, according to Colonel
Kirkpatrick, were,</p>
<p>Nan Dev, (Nanyop Dev&rsquo;,) who began to reign in the year
Sambat 901, (A.D. 843.)</p>
<p>Kamuk Dev, (Gangga Dev&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>Nersingh Dev, (Narasingha Dev&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>Ramsing Dev, (Ram&rsquo;Singha Dev&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>Bhad Sing Dev.</p>
<p>Kurm Sing Dev.</p>
<p>Nan Dev, the founder of this dynasty, according to Colonel
Kirkpatrick, was descended of Bamdeb of the Surijbunsi,
(Suryabangsi,) princes of Oude, (Ayodhya;) but in the Pauranic
lists of these princes I can find nothing like Bamdeb, unless it
be Bhanu or Bhanuman, mentioned both in the Sri Bhagawata and
Bangsa Lots, among the later descendants of Ramachandra.&nbsp;
The objections to this chronology are still stronger than to that
which I received, in so much as it makes it commence still
earlier.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, great room to doubt, whether in reality
Nanyopdev was a Kshatriya.&nbsp; The Brahmans of Mithila, indeed,
are totally unwilling to admit, that a person of any lower rank
could have authority to settle their customs; but in Bengal a
person of the medical tribe obtained this power; and the chiefs
of the low tribe called Bhawar trace their origin to a Nanyopdev
who brought the stud of the king of Dilli to pasture in the
plains of Mithila, then entirely waste.&nbsp; Certain it is, that
the Bhawars, about that time, extended their dominion over the
Gorakhpur district as well as Tirahut, and that many petty chiefs
of that tribe continued to occupy the parts adjacent to the hills
until long after; and many of them continue to this <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>day
to be objects of worship among the low tribes.&nbsp; These may
have been the descendants of collateral branches of the
Raja&rsquo;s family, or of the chief officers of their
government; and it must be remarked, that many of them assumed
the title of Dev, as all the princes descended of Nanyop had
done.</p>
<p>After the death of Hari Singha it is in Mithila generally
admitted, that a Sivai Singha succeeded; and, although the
Bhavans probably then formed the chief population of Gar Samaran
and Tirahut, it is probable, as is asserted, that Sivai Singh vas
a military Brahman of the tribe called Aniwar.&nbsp; It is
alleged by the people of Tirahut, that Sivai having had a dispute
with a brother, this unnatural relation fled to Dilli, and,
having procured an army from the Musulman king, he advanced
towards Gar Samaran with an intention of dethroning his
brother.&nbsp; Before he had reached the Gandaki, Sivai Singha,
having heard of the approach of an army of men that eat beef, was
seized with a panic, and after having reigned twenty-two years,
resigned his kingdom to Kangkali, the tutelar deity of his
capital city.&nbsp; He then dedicated his life to God, and,
having assumed the character of a religious mendicant, he passed
his days in wandering about the places which are esteemed
holy.</p>
<p>It is said, that about this time the unnatural brother of
Sivai Singha died, and that the Musulman army, after a fruitless
attempt on Gar Samaran, were obliged to retreat, owing, as the
Hindus suppose, to the powerful influence of the tutelar
deity.&nbsp; The Musulmans, however, seem to have seized on all
the country near the Ganges, which afterwards continued subject
to them till the establishment of the Company&rsquo;s
authority.</p>
<p>About the same time, the inhabitants deserted Gar Samaran, for
what reason is not explained.&nbsp; They took with them the image
of Kangkali, and retired with an intention of going to <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Nepal.&nbsp; On the route they were in danger of
perishing from hunger, when Kangkali appeared to one of their
chiefs in a dream, and told him, that in the morning she would
grant a supply of provisions, and that she gave them permission
ever afterwards to use the kind of food which she was about to
send.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the morning, a large herd of
buffaloes appeared, and were killed by the people, who ever since
have indulged in that kind of food, which, according to the
precepts of their religion, they had formerly considered
unclean.&nbsp; They afterwards settled in the valley of Nepal,
and are the people now called Newars.</p>
<p>From Dow&rsquo;s translation of Ferishta, <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a> we learn, that Yeas ul deen Tuglick
Shaw, king of Dilli, in the year of Christ 1322, on returning
from an expedition into Bengal, was passing near the hills of
Turhat, (Tirahut,) when the raja of these parts appearing in
arms, was pursued into the woods.&nbsp; Having cut down these,
the royal army arrived at a fort surrounded by a wall, and by
seven ditches filled with water.&nbsp; After a siege of three
weeks the place was taken, and the government of Turhat conferred
upon Achmet Chan.&nbsp; That this is the same story with that
contained in the traditions concerning Sivai Singha and Gar
Samaran, I think there can be little doubt, and the Musulman
chronology is that upon which most reliance can be placed.&nbsp;
Some of the Hindu traditions make Sivai Singha the son of Hari
Deva, others make him of another family which succeeded after an
anarchy of 34 years; but in both cases the period between 1315,
the supposed era of Hari Deva&rsquo;s death, and 1322, the time
of Gar Samaran&rsquo;s capture, is too short, and the difference
between it and the actual time has probably been added, to make
up part of the <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>enormous reigns of Narasingha and
Ramsingha.&nbsp; At any rate, if the people of Gar Samaran
retired to Nepal, and became the Newars, then 1322 (or 1323, as
Colonel Kirkpatrick has it,) <a name="citation50a"></a><a
href="#footnote50a" class="citation">[50a]</a> is the most
probable date of the event.&nbsp; There is nothing improbable in
the circumstance, and the doctrine of cast prevailing among the
Newars is a strong confirmation of their having come from
Hindustan.</p>
<p>It must, however, be confessed, that the Newars themselves
totally deny this origin, and allege, that the only foundation
for it is the resemblance between the names Newar and
Aniwar.&nbsp; They consider themselves as the aboriginal
inhabitants of the country which they now occupy, and their
houses have a great resemblance to those of the Bhotiyas, or
people of Thibet, as described by Captain Turner, while in many
points their customs resemble those of the other tribes of the
Chinese race.&nbsp; It must be, however, observed, that their
features are not clearly marked as of that origin, and that many
of them have high features, large eyes, and oval faces; but
considering the manners of their women, little reliance can be
put on this mark, and the truth will be best discovered by an
examination of their language, of which I have deposited a
copious vocabulary in the Company&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; I think,
indeed, that I can trace many coincidences between it and the
language of the Murmis, a tribe undoubtedly of the Chinese race,
and it appears to me radically different from the Hindwi
language, although religion has no doubt introduced some
Sangskrita words.</p>
<p>A short vocabulary of this language has been given by Colonel
Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> and may perhaps suffice to decide the
language to which it has the greatest affinity.&nbsp; The <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>character in which it is written is evidently derived
from the Nagri of India, and will be found opposite to page 220
in Colonel Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Account of Nepaul.</p>
<p>In treating of the Newars, Colonel Kirkpatrick observes, <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> &ldquo;That this people differ
essentially, so as to prove abundantly that they are an insulated
race of men, whose origin is not to be traced to any of the
nations immediately surrounding them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, if they
came from Samaran, as he supposes, they must have been Hindus;
and, if they are descendants of Thibetians, intermixed with
Hindus, as I suppose, still their origin is to be derived from
the nations immediately contiguous.&nbsp; He goes on to observe,
&ldquo;That the Newars are of a middle size, with broad shoulders
and chest, very stout limbs, round and rather flat faces, small
eyes, low and somewhat spreading noses; yet he cannot agree with
those who affirm, that there is in the general physiognomy of
these people any striking resemblance to the Chinese
features.&rdquo;&nbsp; For my part, I do not well know in what
other terms the Chinese features could be better defined, than in
the description of the Newars thus given by Colonel Kirkpatrick;
and, for a confirmation of a considerable resemblance between the
two people, I may refer to the figures given by this author
opposite to pages 185 and 187, which, although called merely
natives of Nepal, represent in fact Newars.&nbsp; In reality, if
the morals of the Newar women had been more strict, I believe
that the resemblance between the Chinese or Thibetians and Newars
would have been complete; but since the conquest, the approach to
Hindu countenance is rapidly on the increase, women in most cases
giving a decided preference to rank, especially if connected with
arms or religion.&nbsp; Until the conquest, there was <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>probably little intermixture, except in the descendants
of the governing family, which probably was of a mixed breed
between a Thibetian lady and a raja of Banaras, as will be
afterwards mentioned; and this family had, I believe, multiplied
exceedingly, and composed a numerous and warlike gentry, which,
of course, contributed largely to the propagation of the
nation.</p>
<p>The assumption of the military dignity, and of the thread, one
of its badges among the Hindus, and the title Rajput given to all
the chiefs of the mountaineers, seems to have induced Colonel
Kirkpatrick to suppose, that the Kshatriya tribe of India formed
a large portion of the inhabitants in Nepal.&nbsp; Yet he had
with accuracy observed, <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a> that the progeny of
a Newar female and one of these Kshatriyas may almost be taken
for a Malay, that is, a mixed breed between people of a Chinese
race with Hindus and Arabs; and farther, he accurately noticed,
that illegitimate persons of the reigning family by Newar women,
although he supposes their fathers to have been Rajputs, approach
nearer than their mothers to the Tartars or Chinese.&nbsp; The
reason of this, I would say, is, that the royal family are in
fact Magars, a Thibetian race.</p>
<p>In the more rude and mountainous parts of Nepal Proper, the
chief population consisted of these Murmis, who are by many
considered as a branch of the Bhotiyas, or people of Thibet; but,
although in religion and doctrine they followed the example of
that people, and all their priests, called Lamas, studied its
language and science, yet it seems doubtful, whether the two
nations had a common origin; but this will be best ascertained by
a comparison of the languages.&nbsp; For this purpose I have
deposited in the Company&rsquo;s library a copious vocabulary of
the Murmi dialect.&nbsp; The doctrine of the Lamas <!-- page
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>is so
obnoxious to the Gorkhalese, that, under pretence of their being
thieves, no Murmi is permitted to enter the valley where
Kathmandu stands, and by way of ridicule, they are called Siyena
Bhotiyas, or Bhotiyas who eat carrion; for these people have such
an appetite for beef, that they cannot abstain from the oxen that
die a natural death, as they are not now permitted to murder the
sacred animal.&nbsp; They have, therefore, since the conquest,
retired as much as possible into places very difficult of access;
and before the overthrow of Sikim a great many retired to that
country, but there they have not escaped from the power of the
Gorkhalese, and have been obliged to disperse even from that
distant retreat, as they were supposed too much inclined to
favour its infidel chief.&nbsp; They never seem to have had any
share in the government, nor to have been addicted to arms, but
always followed the profession of agriculture, or carried loads
for the Newars, being a people uncommonly robust.&nbsp; Their
buildings are thatched huts, often supported on stages, like
those of the farther India.</p>
<p>The Kiratas, or Kichaks, have been already mentioned as
occupying the country east from Nepal Proper.&nbsp; They seem
always to have been a warlike and enterprising people, but very
rude, although not so illiterate as many of their
neighbours.&nbsp; The Lamas have made great progress in
persuading them to adopt their doctrines; and the Lamas, who gave
them instruction, were skilled in the language of Thibet; but
many adhered to their old customs, and the old priesthood
continued to perform the ceremonies of all.&nbsp; The Rajputs, on
obtaining power, induced many to abandon part of their impure
practices, and to employ Brahmans to perform their ceremonies;
but in general this compliance was only shown when they were at
court.&nbsp; The abstinence from beef, which the Gorkhalese <!--
page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>enforce, is exceedingly disagreeable to the Kirats; and,
although the Lamas have been banished, this people still retain a
high respect for their memory, and a longing after the
flesh-pots.&nbsp; Agam Singha, the chief of the nation, now in
exile, told me plainly, that, although he received a Brahman as
an instructor, it was only because he could not procure a Lama,
and that he considered the chief Lamas as incarnations of
God.</p>
<p>The Kirats, being vigorous beef-eaters, did not readily submit
to the Rajputs.&nbsp; Previous to the invasion of these Hindus
they had, it is true, been compelled to retire to the hills; but
there, until the vast power acquired by the family of Gorkha,
they retained, as I have already mentioned, a great degree of
independence.</p>
<p>I have deposited in the Company&rsquo;s library a full
vocabulary of the Kirata language.&nbsp; They are said to have
had a written character peculiar to themselves; but Agam Singha,
their chief, is no penman, and the people with him, born in
exile, have contented themselves with acquiring the Nagri
character.&nbsp; The Kirats are allowed to marry several wives,
and to keep concubines.&nbsp; Their property is divided equally
among their sons by wives; but the sons by concubines are allowed
a share, though smaller than that given to the offspring of a
virgin spouse.</p>
<p>Among the Kirats was settled a tribe called Limbu, the manners
of which were very nearly the same, and, indeed, the tribes
intermarry; but their languages are said to be different, and it
would not appear that the Lamas had made any progress in
converting the Limbus.&nbsp; Since the overthrow of the Kirats,
and since the reluctance with which they submit to the Gorkhalese
has become evident, it has been the policy of the court of
Kathmandu to show a decided preference to the Limbus, who have
not been disgusted by the loss of power which <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>they never
possessed, nor by the banishment of their priests.&nbsp; They are
not, however, reconciled to the loss of beef; but are certainly
less discontented than any other neighbouring tribe.&nbsp; Their
profession is that of agriculture, and they live in huts.&nbsp; I
was unable to procure any vocabulary of their language, but
Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation55"></a><a
href="#footnote55" class="citation">[55]</a> gives a short list
of the words of the Limbu tongue, which he calls Limbooa.&nbsp;
It has no affinity to the Sangskrita.</p>
<p>Another considerable tribe of Nepal, taken in its most
extended sense, are the Lapchas, who occupy the country between
the Kankayi and Tista, and east from that of the Kiratas; but by
most Hindus they are included under this odious name.&nbsp; Their
manners were very nearly the same with those of the Kirats.&nbsp;
The Lapchas are a set of vigorous barbarians, about one half of
whom had been deluded by the monkish austerities, and superior
learning of the Lamas.</p>
<p>The Lapchas ate beef, pork, and every other thing reckoned
abominable, and drank strong liquors without shame.&nbsp; Their
women did not marry until after they had arrived at the age of
maturity, and had become sensible to the assiduities of
courtship.&nbsp; The Lapchas were chiefly armed with swords and
bows, with which they shot poisoned arrows.&nbsp; Spears were not
in use, being ill fitted for a mountainous country, thickly
overgrown with wood, and where men cannot charge in compact
order.&nbsp; They had a few muskets, but too large to be fired
from the shoulder.&nbsp; They were tied to a tree, and fired by a
match.</p>
<p>It must be observed, that the inhabitants of both Thibet, and
of what we call Bhotan or Bootan, are by the natives of India
called Bhotiyas, and their countries Bhotan or Bhot.&nbsp; <!--
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Some of these people, who inhabit near Kathmandu, call
themselves Sayn; and the same name is given by the Newars to the
whole nation.&nbsp; Thibet, I am inclined to believe, is a
Persian word, totally unknown to the natives.&nbsp; At Kathmandu
I had a patient who had been chief of a territory north from
Lassa, and who had been dispossessed by the Chinese; and, so far
as I could learn from him, the native appellation, at least of
the territory subject to Lassa, is Borka, from whence Bhotiya is
perhaps a corruption; but I could not ascertain any general name
for the countries which we call Thibet.&nbsp; These, however, and
also Bhotan, are inhabited by kindred tribes of people, who
resemble each other strongly in features, complexion, language,
and manners.&nbsp; In the plate opposite to page 40 of
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Nepaul, are well represented, in a sitting
posture, two persons of this nation, although, by some mistake,
probably in the publisher, they are called natives of Nepal.</p>
<p>The Lamas are the priests of the sect of Bouddh, in Thibet and
the adjacent territories, and are monks, who have nominally at
least forsaken the pleasures of the world.&nbsp; They totally
reject the doctrine of cast, and a person of any nation may be
admitted into the order.&nbsp; The whole, at least of those at a
distance, consider themselves as under the authority of Sakya
Gomba, who came from India about the time of Jesus Christ, and
has ever since resided at Lassa, where he remains in perpetual
youth.&nbsp; On this account he is not considered as an
incarnation, (Avatar.)&nbsp; There are, however, many personages
of this sect who are considered as incarnations of different
Buddhas, or persons who have obtained divinity.&nbsp; These enter
into the bodies of children, and inspire them through life; and
when the body dies, the deity enters into another.&nbsp; Of this
nature is the Dharma Raja, or spiritual chief of what we <!--
page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>call Bhotan; and still more celebrated is the Tishu
Lama, who resides at Degarchi, and is the spiritual guide of the
Chinese emperors.&nbsp; This class of supposed deities seems to
be pretty numerous, as, in the territory of the Lapcha and
Kirats, their number would appear to have been at least twelve,
as so many were known to my informant, who was only well
acquainted with the former territory.&nbsp; The ordinary lamas
pretend only to be saints.&nbsp; The best account I have seen of
their doctrine is that given by the learned Pallas, which is much
more complete than any I could procure in Nepal.&nbsp; The
followers of Buddh have had five great lawgivers, and a sixth is
daily expected.&nbsp; As each of these is supposed to have been
an incarnation of a Buddh or Bourkan, and as all have been
usually taken as one person, we may readily account for the
difference that prevails in the opinions concerning the era when
this sect arose.&nbsp; Gautama is the fourth of those lawgivers,
and his doctrine alone is received by the priests of Ava, who
reject the fifth as a heretic; but by the Bouddhists of Nepal,
Thibet, Tartary, and China, he is named Sakya.&nbsp; Gautama,
according to the best authorities, lived in the sixth century
before the Christian era, and Sakya in the first century after
the birth of our Lord.</p>
<p>Although there is no distinction of cast among the Sayn or
Bhotiyas, yet they are not without differences in religious
opinions; for some of them in Nepal worship at Swayambhunath,
while others prefer a temple of Bouddhama, which is situated near
Pasupanath.&nbsp; The doctrine of Sakya Singha differs most
essentially from that of Gautama.&nbsp; The Bhotiyas, following
the former, worship all the spirits, that by the Burmas are
called Nat, a practice which is held in abhorrence by the Rahans
of Ava.&nbsp; They also consider the Buddhs as emanations from a
supreme deity, view many of their Lamas as incarnations of a <!--
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Buddh, and accordingly worship them as living Gods,
although they do not consider them as equal to Sakya, who is the
Lama of Lassa.&nbsp; There is among the Lamas no prohibition
against the laity from studying any character or any book; but
they must have wonderfully degraded the human understanding, when
they can induce the people to swallow the belief in the deities
living among them.&nbsp; It is true, that these are in all
probability very much secluded, and rarely shown to the vulgar,
except at a very great distance, and in obscurity; but still this
seems to be nearly the utmost height of human imbecility.</p>
<p>The belief of Sakya having lived among them since about the
commencement of the Christian era, is probably confined to Nepal,
and other remote parts, where no means of knowing the contrary
exists.&nbsp; Such an absurdity could scarcely pass among actual
observers, however degraded in understanding, and in Thibet the
Lama of Lassa is probably considered as merely an incarnation of
Sakya.</p>
<p>Besides the countries which we call Thibet and Bootan, the
Bhotiyas occupy, every where between the Kali and the Tista, the
Alpine region adjacent to the snowy peaks of Emodus, on both
sides of that chief of mountains, where none of the highland
tribes above mentioned can endure the cold of winter any more
than the Bhotiyas can suffer the moderate summer heats of
Kathmandu.&nbsp; This induces me to think, that the present
highland tribes, although of the same race with the people of
Thibet, had originally occupied the plains, and, on the invasion
of the present Hindus, had retired to the mountains, so far as
they considered the temperature of the air tolerable, just as a
colony of Hindus had retired to the same quarter, to avoid
Mohammedan intolerance.&nbsp; In a region so extended, as that
occupied by the Bhotiya nation, it is probable, that <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>there
exists a great variety of custom and dialect, for I heard of many
different kinds, even among those who inhabit the southern face
of Emodus; but the accounts given by people of different tribes
and languages, differed so much, that I can say nothing
satisfactory on the subject, especially as the season, when I
resided on the frontier, was totally insufferable to a Bhotiya,
so that I had no opportunity of conversing with them; the Lama
from whom I received an account of the Lapchas being by birth a
Murmi.</p>
<p>I have already said that the Murmis are by many considered as
a kind of Bhotiyas, but this the Lama denied, and the languages
seem to have little affinity.&nbsp; I heard, besides, of Khat,
Sirmi, and Kutung or Kutiya Bhotiyas, but cannot venture to speak
of the nature of these distinctions, farther than to state, that
the Khat Bhotiyas are mentioned by Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> as having long governed Nepal before
the Newars, and as at this time occupying the lower parts of
Bhotan, (Kachar,) on which subject I have already given my
opinion.&nbsp; The resemblance to be traced between the Newar and
Murmi languages, induces me to suppose that these two tribes are
originally the same, and the historical hints given by Colonel
Kirkpatrick induce me to draw the conclusion, that the Newars are
Khat Bhotiyas, who have adopted some new customs in consequence
of a greater connection with the Hindus.&nbsp; I never, indeed,
heard the Murmis and Khat Bhotiyas mentioned as the same; but the
former I have often heard named Siyena Bhotiyas, which is very
likely to be another appellation for the Khat Bhotiyas, one name
implying wild or forest Bhotiyas, and the other implying Bhotiyas
who eat carrion like jackalls.</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>The Bhotiyas, at least the greater part of those in
Thibet, neglect agriculture, and, like the Dasnami Sannyasis of
Puraniya, chiefly pursue commerce and a life of monkish
austerity, but occasionally they wield the sword; and the
principal support of the country is in its mines, and its
numerous and various herds of cattle.&nbsp; The quantity of grain
is said to be very inconsiderable, and both it and the herds of
cattle are probably reared by some inferior tribe; but on this
subject I have not yet had sufficient information.&nbsp; I have
only learned, that the highest and proper Bhotiyas confine their
attention entirely to religion, commerce, and arms, and it is in
the first alone that they have had much success.</p>
<p>One circumstance relative to the Bhotiyas is remarkable, and
seems to me to decide a matter that has long been agitated
concerning the natural history of man.&nbsp; All those that I
have seen at Kathmandu, not only from the territory of Gorkha,
but from Mostong, Kuti, Lasa, and Degarchi, are as black as the
natives of Canton or Ava.&nbsp; Climate is not, therefore, able
to change the colour of a nation; but it seems to have a greater
effect on the temperament.&nbsp; Cold can produce a change of
temperament from the melancholic and choleric to the phlegmatic
and sanguine, and heat acting on the human frame, is capable of
producing a contrary revolution.&nbsp; Hence, rosy cheeks and
lips are frequently observed among the mountain Hindus of Nepal,
although they are very little fairer than those of Madras.</p>
<p>Such are the principal tribes that occupy the mountains
subject to the dominion of Nepal, or rather of Gorkha.&nbsp; In
the plains adjacent to the mountains, and subject to the same
prince, are several other tribes; but it is my intention to treat
of them when I describe the Company&rsquo;s provinces, where the
greater part of these tribes is now found.</p>

<p>I shall next proceed to give a general view of the appearance,
soil, climate, and productions of the country, and for this
purpose I must divide it into four stages of elevation.&nbsp; My
actual observations are confined to the three lower of these, and
I have seen these only in the vicinity of the capital.&nbsp; What
I say concerning the highest region is, therefore, entirely from
report, and what I mention concerning the others, so far as I
write from actual observation, is strictly applicable only to the
parts near the capital; but inquiries have enabled me to judge,
that a great similarity prevails over the whole territory, and
whatever differences have come to my knowledge <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>shall be
mentioned either in this part, or when I come to treat of the
different principalities, which have now been subjected to the
chief of Gorkha.</p>
<p>The lowest region is a part of the great plain of
Hindustan.&nbsp; In a few places the Company&rsquo;s territory
extends to the foot of the mountains which bound the great plain
on the north, which are called Himadri, Himachul, Himalichul, or
Himaliya, and which form the Emodus of the ancients: but in most
parts the dominions of Gorkha extend about twenty miles into the
plain, and it seems in general to have been the policy of the
princes of India to allow the mountain chiefs, even when very
petty, to retain at least this extent of the low country, as
being too obnoxious to their incursions to be of a value adequate
to defray the expense of its defence.&nbsp; At times, some of the
mountain tribes, which had acquired power, have been able to
extend their authority over the plains much farther, and as none
of them have ever equalled in power the chiefs of Gorkha, these
have for some time been eager in taking every opportunity of
encroachment; but although powerful, they have been opposed by a
force vastly more formidable than was ever before known in India,
and this has checked their power, which might have been very
formidable to an undisciplined state however extensive.</p>
<p>This low region is called Tariyani, Tarai, or Ketoni, and, as
I have said, is, in general, about twenty miles in width.&nbsp;
In this space there are a few scattered small hills, and much
poor high land overgrown with trees and bushes of little value;
but there is, also, a very large proportion of rich land, and on
the whole the soil is much better than in the adjacent parts of
the Company&rsquo;s territory.</p>
<p>I do not intend here to enter into a detailed account of its
productions; because they are nearly the same with those of <!--
page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>the Company&rsquo;s adjacent territory, of which it is
my intention to give hereafter a full account, only being less
cultivated, there are in the Tariyani more wild beasts,
especially elephants and rhinoceroses.&nbsp; The breed of the
former is considered as uncommonly bad, and it has been lately
remarked to me by Mr Venour, the surgeon at Puraniya, that every
one of them has a toe of some one of its feet very much
lengthened, which gives the foot an unseemly appearance.&nbsp; So
far as I have been able to observe since, the remark of Mr Venour
is accurate; but the number of elephants of this kind that I have
seen is not great.&nbsp; In the dry season the elephants retire
to the lower ranges of hills; but in the rainy season they
abandon these forests, and are then very destructive to the
crops, which, indeed, prevents the natives from being so
attentive to the cultivation of rice as they otherwise would be,
so that, although the country is best adapted for the culture of
this grain, the farmers content themselves chiefly with winter
crops of wheat, barley, and mustard.&nbsp; The Raja reserves to
himself the sole right of catching the elephants, and annually
procures a considerable number.&nbsp; They are sold on his
account at 200 Mohurs, or 86 rupees, for every cubit of their
height; but five cubits of the royal measure are only six English
feet.&nbsp; As few merchants are willing to give this price for
elephants which have not been seasoned, the Raja generally forces
them on such persons as have claims on the court, who sell their
elephants in the best manner they can.&nbsp; Tigers are not so
numerous as might have been expected in a country so
uncultivated.&nbsp; Black bears of a great size are more
numerous, and are very troublesome.&nbsp; Wild hogs, hog-deer,
hares, foxes, and jackalls, are to be found in abundance.</p>
<p>In the waste lands of the Tariyani, the most common trees are
the <i>Palas</i>, (<i>Erythina monosperma</i>, Lamarck,) and the
<i>Simul</i>, (<i>Bombax heptaphyllum</i>, Lamarck;) but by far
the greater part <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>of these wastes is covered with long
grass or reeds, which once a year are burned, in order to keep
the country clear, and to improve the pasture.&nbsp; Owing to the
moisture and coolness of the air, the fields, at all seasons,
preserve some verdure, but the grass seems to be of a very bad
quality, as the cattle, although abundantly supplied with it, are
to the last degree wretched; still, however, in the heats of
spring, very large herds are sent from the Company&rsquo;s
provinces to these wastes.&nbsp; In these, also, there grows a
great quantity of the species of <i>Isch&aelig;mum</i> called
<i>Sabe</i>, of which ropes are made, and of which a good deal is
exported to the territory of the Company.</p>
<p>Before the conquest by the Nepalese, the petty Rajas, who
governed its different portions, were so much afraid of their
neighbours, that they did not promote the cultivation of this low
land.&nbsp; They rather encouraged extensive woods, and contented
themselves, in a great measure, with the produce of the forests
in timber, elephants, and pasture; even then, however, many rich
spots were occupied, and very productive; but they were so buried
in the forests as to be little observable.&nbsp; The Gorkhalese,
being more confident, have cleared much of the country, although
still a great deal remains to be done.&nbsp; Even now they export
a considerable quantity of grain; and, were property somewhat
more secure, this territory is capable of yielding considerable
resources.&nbsp; Its tobacco is said to be uncommonly good, and
the reddish cotton wool is said to be very thriving.</p>
<p>In the annexed register of the weather, the state of the
atmosphere, during the two months stay which I made in the
country, will be seen.&nbsp; The climate is considerably cooler
and moister than that in the vicinity of Patna; and the hot
winds, according to report, are almost a month later in <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>commencing, than they are at that city.&nbsp; Our
residence in the Tariyani was at the most favourable season; but
about the time (1st April) at which we advanced towards Nepal,
the country becomes very unhealthy, good water for drinking
becomes very scarce, and, till the cold season, the people are
very subject to fevers and disorders in the bowels, which by the
natives of Nepal are attributed to the Ayul, or a poisonous air,
which many of them imagine proceeds from the breath of large
serpents, supposed to inhabit the forests of the northern
mountains.&nbsp; The existence of such serpents in any
considerable number, is very doubtful, and rational men assign a
more natural origin to the Ayul or bad air.&nbsp; They say, that
the ground in the forests, during spring, is covered with fallen
leaves, which are rotted by the first rains of the hot season,
and, by their putrefaction, corrupt the air.&nbsp; They
accordingly allege, that the climate continues healthy, until the
first rain after the commencement of the hot season, after which
the unhealthy season begins, and continues until the cold
weather, although it abates considerably of its virulence with
the heavy rains which happen after the solstice.</p>
<p>The Tariyani is intersected by numerous small rivers, which
not only serve for watering the crops in the latter end of the
dry season; but, when they are swollen by rain, become navigable,
and enable the farmer to send the produce of his fields to a good
market.&nbsp; These rivers also serve to float down the valuable
timber that abounds in the forests, by which the hills are
skirted.&nbsp; The term Tariyani, indeed implies the
country&rsquo;s being navigable.</p>
<p>Fish are found in abundance in the rivers of the Tariyani; and
the mullet, which I call Mugil Corsula, and the carp, which I
call Cyprinus Rohita, are of an excellent quality.</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Bounding the above mentioned plain on the north, is a
region of nearly the same width.&nbsp; It consists of small
hills, rising, however, gradually towards the north, and watered
by many small rivers, which spring from the southern faces of the
first lofty mountains, to which these hills gradually unite.</p>
<p>The channels of these rivers or torrents, even when they have
no communication with the high mountains, are filled with
fragments of granite and shistose mica; but the hills themselves
are in general composed of clay, intermixed with various
proportions of sand, mica, and gravel.&nbsp; This mixture
contains many masses of rock, and is disposed in strata, that are
either horizontal, or dip towards the north with an angle less
than 25 degrees.&nbsp; In many places, these heterogeneous
materials have been indurated into stone of considerable
hardness.&nbsp; But besides those, I observed many rocks in these
hills, especially in deep vallies, where they were disposed in
vertical strata, running easterly and westerly, and consisting of
limestone, hornstone, and aggregates, usually called
primitive.&nbsp; These parts abound in incrustations, formed by
the deposition of calcareous matter; but I have not been able to
hear of the exuvi&aelig; of marine animals, except such as are
washed down by the Gandaki, and are loose in its channel.&nbsp;
The calcareous matter has either formed itself in crusts,
covering the surface of rocks, or has assumed the form of the
mosses, lichens, and other such plants, that it has covered.</p>
<p>On the bank of the Kosi, near Varaha Chhatra, is found a
singular black ferruginous earth, of which the elephant is said
to eat greedily, when indisposed; and the natives use it, rubbed
with a little water, to supply the place of ink.</p>
<p>The lower part of these hills, and some of the adjacent <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>plains, are the grand seat of the Sal <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a> forests, among which are many trees of
the species of <i>Dalbergia</i>, called <i>Sisau</i>, <a
name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a> and of the <i>Cedrella</i>, which at
Calcutta, is called <i>Tungd</i>, (<i>toon</i> of the English,)
but which in the forests adjacent to Puraniya, is called
<i>Chilli kath</i>.&nbsp; Higher up, the hills are covered with a
vast variety of trees, nearly resembling those of
<i>Goyalpara</i>, of which I intend hereafter to give an account;
but in the hills of the North, there are many pines (<i>Pinus
longifolia</i>,) which the mountain Hindus call <i>Salla</i>, <a
name="citation67c"></a><a href="#footnote67c"
class="citation">[67c]</a> and an abundance of the <i>Mimosa</i>
(<i>Khaira</i>,) of which catechu is made.&nbsp; A great many
people are employed in preparing this drug.&nbsp; A few of them
belong to the company&rsquo;s territory, but by far the greater
part are the subjects of Gorkha.&nbsp; Each man pays a duty to
the Raja, of from three to five rupees, and during the fair
season makes from eight to ten <i>mans</i> of the Calcutta
weight, which is nearly 82 lbs.&nbsp; The merchants, who advance
money for subsistence, usually give the workman four rupees a
man, that is, from 32 to 40 rupees for six months work; but from
this the tax must be deducted.&nbsp; The greater part is sent to
Patna and Banaras.</p>
<p>In these woods, a vast number of these kinds of birds which
are tamed by the natives on account of their singing or imitating
the human voice, form their nests, which are considered as the
property of the Raja.&nbsp; These birds are,</p>
<p>Mayna, Gracula religiosa, Latham.</p>
<p>Amrita chela.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Madna, Kajla, Two parakeets nearly allied to the
Psittacus gingianus of Latham.</p>
<p>Tetiya, Psittaca torquata, Brisson.</p>
<p>Chandana, a parakeet not described by Latham.</p>
<p>Sugi, Psittacus gingianus, Latham.</p>
<p>Latkan, a small short-tailed parakeet, nearly allied to the
Psittacus galgulus.</p>
<p>The right of taking the young birds from the nest is farmed to
men, who again employ people to climb the trees, when the birds
are first fledged.&nbsp; These people keep the birds for two
months, and then deliver one half to the renter, and take the
remainder to themselves.&nbsp; Petty dealers come from the low
country, purchase the birds, and disperse them through
Bengal.</p>
<p>In several places, these low hills are separated from the high
mountains by fine vallies of a considerable length, but a good
deal elevated above the plain of Hindustan.&nbsp; In the country
west from the Ganges, these vallies are called by the generic
name Dun, analogous to the Scottish word Strath; but towards the
east, the word Dun is unknown, nor did I hear of any generic term
used there for such vallies, although there are very fine ones in
that part of the country.</p>
<p>These Duns or Straths are tolerably cultivated by the same
tribes that dwell in the great plain of Hindustan.&nbsp; But
among the spurs and ridges of these hills, there are many narrow
vallies, or what in Scotland would be called Glens, and both
these, although their soil is rich, and the surrounding hills,
are almost totally neglected.&nbsp; A few straggling villages are
however scattered through the woods, especially in the higher
parts, and their inhabitants cultivate cotton, rice, and other
articles, with the hoe, after having cleared away parts of the
forest, as practised by the Garos of Ranggapur.&nbsp; The chief
reason of the <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>desert state of this part of the
country, seems to be its extreme unhealthiness, and this again,
in a great measure, in all probability, depends on the want of
cultivation; for Vijaypur Chatra and some other places, that must
be included in this division, are abundantly healthy, having been
well cleared.</p>
<p>Some estimate of the temperature of this region may be formed
from the heat of a spring at Bichhakor, having, in the end of
March, been found 74&deg; of Fahrenheit&rsquo;s scale, the
latitude being 27&deg; 16&prime; N.</p>
<p>On arriving at what may be called the mountains, though they
are not separated from the low hills by any distinct boundary, we
have a very elevated region, consisting of one mountain heaped on
another, and rising to a great height, so that, when any fall
happens in winter, their tops are for a short time covered with
snow.&nbsp; The inhabited vallies between these are in general
very narrow, and are of very various degrees of elevation,
probably from 3000 to 6000 feet of perpendicular height above the
plains of Puraniya.&nbsp; Of course, they differ very much in
their temperature; so that some of them abound in the ratan and
bamboo, both of enormous dimension, while others produce only
oaks and pines.&nbsp; Some ripen the pine-apple and sugar-cane,
while others produce only barley, millet, and other grains.</p>
<p>Some estimate of the climate of this region may be formed by
means of the accompanying register of the weather kept near
Kathmandu, although it is very imperfect, from that want of
convenience which must attend travellers in so remote a
country.&nbsp; The winter we passed in Nepal, was reckoned
uncommonly mild; and in place of the rain, which we had at that
season, in most years snow falls at Kathmandu.&nbsp; A more
accurate estimate of the average heat of the valley may be
obtained from that of its springs, which by repeated trials at a
fine <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>spring nearly on a level with Kathmandu, I found to be
64&deg; of Fahrenheit&rsquo;s thermometer; but in a spring near
Thankot, the heat in April was 59&frac12;&deg;; in one at
Chitlong it was a degree lower; and at Bhimphedi, on the skirts
of the lower hills, it was 63&deg;.&nbsp; This cold, so uncommon
in the latitude of between 27&deg; 30&prime;, and 26&deg;
41&prime;, must be attributed to the great elevation of the
country, for the neighbourhood of the snowy peaks of Emodus could
produce little effect, as the winds were very seldom from that
quarter.&nbsp; We have no data upon which we can calculate the
height of the valley of Nepal with any considerable
accuracy.&nbsp; The nearest approach I can make to it, is by the
difference of the average height of the barometer observed during
the month of February 1802, in the Tariyani, and during the
February following at Kathmandu.&nbsp; The average height at the
former place was 29,60 inches, while at the latter it was 25,25
inches.&nbsp; The difference of the logarithms of these numbers,
rejecting the index, and taking only the four next figures, will
give 690 fathoms, 4140 feet, for the height of Kathmandu above
the Tariyani.&nbsp; The observations with the thermometer, for
the proper correction of those made with the barometer, are not
complete; but they are not of great consequence, considering that
the fundamental observations were not simultaneous, and were
therefore liable to great error.</p>
<p>The periodical rains extend to Nepal, and are nearly of the
same violence and duration with those in Behar.&nbsp; Colonel
Kirkpatrick <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a> thinks, and perhaps justly, that they
commence a little earlier.&nbsp; Water spouts are common, which
shows that their cause is quite unconnected with the sea.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>On the whole I am inclined to believe, that the climate
of the valley is healthful, although, immediately before our
arrival, the inhabitants had been much troubled with fevers, and,
for the first three months after our arrival, the whole of our
native attendants were exceedingly sickly.&nbsp; The complaints
to which they were chiefly subject, were fevers of the
intermittent kind, and fluxes, attended with a very copious
secretion of slimy matter, which, by the natives, is attributed
to Bayu or wind; and which was brought on by very slight
indulgences in eating.&nbsp; In the fevers emetics seemed much
more efficacious than the cathartics which are usually employed
at Calcutta; and, indeed, a dose of emetic tartar very frequently
cut the fever short, as usual in temperate climates.&nbsp; The
fluxes were not attended with much pain, and both these and the
tendency in the bowels to the slimy secretions, seemed to require
the frequent exhibition of spirituous bitters and small doses of
opium.&nbsp; In such cases, I found the chirata tolerably
efficacious, but I thought other bitters more powerful,
especially the infusion of chamomile flowers, and the compound
tinctures of Gentian and Peruvian bark.&nbsp; Our people probably
suffered from having passed through the forest too late in the
season; but the natives of Hindustan do not support a change of
air, and on our first arrival they were not well provided with
means to resist the weather, which to them was uncommonly
cold.</p>
<p>I have seen no country where the venereal disease is so common
as in Nepal, nor so generally diffused among all classes of the
people, who are indeed very dissolute.&nbsp; During my stay I had
application for medical assistance from all ranks labouring under
the venereal disease; and I observed that the men did not
consider it as extraordinary or shameful, when they found their
wives afflicted with this malady.&nbsp; The <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>dissolute
manners of the inhabitants are carried to such a length, that a
great many of the young men of rank, by the age of twenty-five,
are debilitated, and have recourse to stimulants.&nbsp; The
preparation of these forms a chief source of emolument to the
medical men, and they are sometimes taken to a quantity that
proves fatal.</p>
<p>Cutaneous disorders, and especially the itch, are also very
common, and almost as prevalent as in Hindustan.&nbsp; The
leprosy, in which the joints drop off, is as common as in Bengal;
but in Nepal it cannot be attributed to the lowness of the
country, nor to a fish diet, to which the people of Kathmandu
have little or no inclination.&nbsp; Some of the persons
afflicted with this horrid disorder, I found to be of
considerable rank, and quite removed from the want of a
nourishing diet.&nbsp; I am almost certain that this disease is
not infectious, as I know an instance of a woman, who has lost
all her toes and fingers, and who, in that state, has had a
child, which she nursed.&nbsp; The child is two years old, and is
very healthy.&nbsp; The natives consider the disease as
hereditary, and allege that the child will become its victim.</p>
<p>The same kind of swelling in the throat that is common among
the inhabitants of the Alps, prevails in Nepal, and, indeed, is
frequently seen every where north from Patna.&nbsp; It might at
first sight be supposed, that this disease does not derive its
origin from the people drinking the water which came from
mountains covered with perpetual snow, the cause to which in
Europe it has been usually attributed.&nbsp; No water of this
kind, however, flows through Nepal; for, although some of the
inhabitants of the northern part of Bahar, who live near the
Ganduki and Kausiki, drink the water springing from perpetual
snow; yet by far the greater part of them drink the water <!--
page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>of the various branches of the Vagmati, all of which
arise in sub-alpine regions.&nbsp; It must, however, be observed,
that the springs by which these rivers are fed may be supplied by
the melted snow, which may sink into the earth of the Himalaya
mountains, and not come to light till it reaches the lower
hills.</p>
<p>As the seasons resemble those of Bengal, and the periodical
rains occupy the greater part of summer, the country is not
favourable for many kinds of fruit: the heats of spring are not
sufficient to bring them to maturity before the rainy season
begins, as is the case in Bengal.&nbsp; Peaches grow wild by
every rill; but the one side of the fruit is rotted by the rain,
while the other is still green.&nbsp; There are vines, but
without shelter from the rain the fruit will always be bad.&nbsp;
Two kinds of fruit, however, come to the utmost perfection; the
pine apple, in the warmer vallies, is uncommonly fine; and the
orange, as it ripens in winter, is nowhere better.</p>
<p>From the abundance of rain in the warm season, the country,
considering the inequality of its surface, is uncommonly
productive of grain.&nbsp; Wherever the land can be levelled into
terraces, however narrow, it is exceedingly favourable for
transplanted rice, which ripens after the rains have ceased, so
that the harvest is never injured; and, as most of these terraces
can be supplied at pleasure with water from springs, the crops
are uncommonly certain.&nbsp; This is by far the most valuable
land, and is that in which all the officers and servants of the
Crown are paid, and from whence all endowments are made.&nbsp; In
some parts the same land gives a winter crop of wheat and barley;
but in most places this is most judiciously omitted.</p>
<p>Where the land is too steep to be conveniently formed into
terraces, or where this operation has been neglected, the fields
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>are called Kuriya, <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a> and are generally
cultivated after fallows, by any person that chooses to occupy
them, on paying a certain sum by the head, and not according to
the extent of land.&nbsp; The hoe is chiefly used, and the
produce is rice, sown broadcast, maize, cotton, <i>kurthi</i>,
<i>bhot mash</i>, and <i>mash kalai</i>, three kinds of pulse,
that, without seeing, I cannot pretend to specify; <i>ture</i>, a
kind of mustard, which I cannot specify; <i>manjit</i>, or Indian
madder, wheat, barley, and sugar cane.</p>
<p>The manjit, or Indian madder, seems to be of two kinds; the
<i>Rubia cordata</i> of Wildenow, and a species of Rubia, not
described in the common systems of botany.&nbsp; Both seem to be
equally fit for the purpose, and grow in the same manner.&nbsp;
It is cultivated exactly as cotton is among the hills.&nbsp; The
ground is cleared and laboured in spring, and, when the first
rains commence, the field is sown broadcast with rice, having
intermixed the seed of manjit or of cotton.&nbsp; When the rice
ripens, it is cut.&nbsp; The manjit is allowed to grew four or
five years; and, after the second year, the stems are annually
cut down to the root.&nbsp; They are four or five cubits long,
and lie flat on the ground.&nbsp; When cut, they are stript of
the leaves, and rolled up for sale.</p>
<p>Besides these, a most valuable article of cultivation, in
these mountainous parts, is a large species of cardamom, of which
I have as yet seen no description.&nbsp; The fruit is larger than
that of the <i>Cardamomum minus</i> of Rumph, and has membraneous
angles; but, in other respects, the two plants have a strong
resemblance.&nbsp; In Hindustan, the cardamom of Nepal is called
the Desi Elachi, while the small cardamom of Malabar (<i>Amomum
repens</i>, W.) is called the Gujjarati Elachi, as having usually
come by the way of Surat.&nbsp; The plant in question is <!--
page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>a species of amomum, as that genus is defined by Dr
Roxburgh, and differs very much from the cardamom of
Malabar.&nbsp; The natives call it merely Elachi.&nbsp; It is
raised in beds, that are levelled, and surrounded by a small
bank, like a field of rice; for it requires to be constantly in
water.&nbsp; In spring, cuttings of the roots are planted in
these beds, at about a cubit&rsquo;s distance from each other,
and must be carefully weeded and supplied with water, so that the
soil is always covered two or three inches.&nbsp; In about three
years the plants begin to produce, and ever afterwards, in the
month Bhadra, give an annual crop.&nbsp; The heads, which spring
up among the leaves, are plucked, and, at the same time, old
withered stems and leaves and weeds are carefully removed.&nbsp;
The capsules are then separated, dried, and packed for sale.</p>
<p>In the country between Nepal Proper, and the Kali river,
ginger is also a valuable article of cultivation.</p>
<p>On the whole, one-half of the cultivation among the mountains
may be said to consist in transplanted rice.&nbsp; The remainder
is composed of the various articles above mentioned, sown on the
Kuriya, or steep land.&nbsp; For a more particular account of the
agriculture, I must refer to the third section of the first
chapter of the second part, where I have detailed all that I know
on this subject, so far as relates to Nepal Proper.</p>
<p>The pasture on these mountains, although not so harsh and
watery as that of the low country, is by no means good, and seems
greatly inferior to that even on the heaths of Scotland.</p>
<p>The Gurung and Limbu tribes, already described, are, however,
shepherds provided with numerous flocks.&nbsp; In winter they
retire to the lower mountains and vallies; but in summer they
ascend to the Alpine regions, which bound the country on the
north, and feed their herds on some extensive tracts in the
vicinity of the regions perpetually frozen, but which in <!--
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>winter are deeply covered with snow.&nbsp; The sheep
which these people possess are said to be very large, and are
called Barwal, and their wool is said to be fine.&nbsp; It is
woven into a cloth, which is finer than that of Bhotan.&nbsp; The
sheep of this breed give also much milk, with which, if I
understand the account of the natives right, they make a kind of
cheese.&nbsp; Whether or not the Barwal is of the same breed with
the sheep employed to carry loads, and afterwards to be
mentioned, I do not exactly know.</p>
<p>There is another kind of sheep called San-Bhera, which are
never sent to the Alpine pastures.</p>
<p>The cattle of the ox kind resemble those of the low country,
and are not numerous.</p>
<p>Buffaloes are brought from the low country and fattened for
slaughter, but are not bred.&nbsp; The same is the case with hogs
and goats, although the country seems admirably adapted for the
latter kind of cattle.</p>
<p>Horses are imported from Thibet, for they do not breed on the
south side of the Alps.&nbsp; The same is the case with the
Chaungri cattle, (<i>Bos grunniens</i>,) and the goat which
produces the wool from whence shawls are made.</p>
<p>This part of the country consists in many places of granite,
and contains much iron, lead, and copper, with some zinc
(<i>Dasta</i>) and a little gold found in the channels of some
rivers.&nbsp; The specimens which I procured of the ores were so
small, that I can say little concerning their nature.&nbsp; The
copper ore which I saw adhered to whitish hornstone, or earthy
quartz.&nbsp; The iron ore is a dark red stony substance, with a
fine grain.&nbsp; I have not seen any of the lead or zinc
ores.&nbsp; The following details respecting the management of
these mines, will enable the reader to judge concerning their
value.</p>
<p>The copper mines seem to be quite superficial, and the ore
<!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>is dug from trenches entirely open above, so that the
workmen cannot act in the rainy season, as they have not even
sense to make a drain.&nbsp; Each mine has attached to it certain
families, who seem to be a kind of proprietors, as no one else is
allowed to dig.&nbsp; These miners are called Agari.&nbsp; Each
man in the month digs, on an average, from two to four
<i>mans</i> of the ore, that is, about 30 <i>mans</i> in the
year.&nbsp; The <i>man</i> is 40 <i>sers</i> of 64 <i>sicca</i>
weight, so that the total ore dug by each man may be about 1970
lb.&nbsp; This is delivered to another set of workmen, named
Kami, who smelt, and work in metals.&nbsp; These procure
charcoal, the Raja furnishing trees, and smelt the ore.&nbsp;
This is first roasted, then put in water for two or three days,
then powdered, and finally put in small furnaces, each containing
from two to three <i>sers</i>, or from three to five pounds of
the powdered ore.&nbsp; Two <i>sers</i> of ore give from one to
one and a half <i>ser</i> of metal, or, on an average, 62&frac12;
per cent.&nbsp; The total copper, therefore, procured by one
miner&rsquo;s labour is 1232 lb.&nbsp; Of this, the man takes
&#8531; = 410&#8532; lb., the Raja takes as much, the smelter
takes 1/5 = 246&#8532; lb.&nbsp; The remainder, 164-3/11 lb. is
divided equally between the Raja, the miner, and a person called
Izaradar, who keeps the accounts, usually advances a subsistence
to the whole party, and often gives loans even to the Raja, the
system of anticipation being universally prevalent.&nbsp; The
miner, therefore, makes about 465 lb. of copper in the year, and
the Raja, for each miner, has as much.&nbsp; The smelter gets
about 300 lb. but one smelter suffices for about two miners, so
that he makes better wages.&nbsp; It must be observed, that
copper bears in India a much greater value in proportion to
silver than it does in Europe, so that the profits of the miner
are high.</p>
<p>The iron ore is also found near the surface, and the mines of
it are nearly on the same footing as those of copper, only the
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>same persons (Kami) dig and smelt, and are allowed one
third of the whole produce, while the Raja and superintendent
(Izaradar) receive each as much.&nbsp; I have received no
estimate of the amount of each man&rsquo;s labour.&nbsp; The iron
of different mines is of very different qualities, some being so
excellent, that, even without being converted into steel, it
makes knives and swords.</p>
<p>Only two mines of lead are at present wrought, because all the
metal is reserved for the Raja&rsquo;s magazines; but, so far as
I can learn, lead is found in a great many places quite on the
surface.&nbsp; These, however, are concealed with care by those
who observe them, and who are thus able to work in private.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation78a"></a><a
href="#footnote78a" class="citation">[78a]</a> was informed, that
the people, owing to want of skill, could not smelt their lead
ore, and procured the metal from Patna; but it would be
extraordinary, if a people who could smelt iron and copper,
should be unable to smelt lead.&nbsp; He, in the same place,
observes, that the lead of Nepal, as usual, contains silver.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick had received information of mines of
antimony and mercury, but considered the information vague.&nbsp;
I am well assured of the existence of the latter in the form of a
native cinnabar, which is called <i>Sabita</i> by the natives,
and is exported to the low country for sale.</p>
<p>The position of such of the mines as have come to my
knowledge, will be seen in the maps.</p>
<p>Mines of sulphur are said to be numerous in these
regions.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation78b"></a><a
href="#footnote78b" class="citation">[78b]</a> says, that the
government of Gorkha was obliged to desist from working them, on
account of their <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>deleterious qualities.&nbsp; This was
probably owing to an admixture of arsenic, which he says is also
found.</p>
<p>Corundum of the compact kind, such as is found in the western
provinces under the presidency of Bengal, is called Kurran by the
Hindus of the mountains, and is found in great quantities on the
hills of Isma and Musikot; and at Kathmandu, I was shown some of
a coarse nature, said to be brought from the surrounding
mountains; but what is most esteemed in that capital is said to
come from Thibet.&nbsp; In both the Company&rsquo;s territory and
in Nepal, it is always found in detached rounded masses lying on
the surface, but often of considerable size.&nbsp; In Nepal,
these masses seldom exceed four or five pounds, but in the
Company&rsquo;s provinces they are much larger.</p>
<p>I saw masses of the Agalmatolite, used in China to make
images, and in Ava for pencils.&nbsp; They were said to be
brought from the mountains in the vicinity of Kathmandu.</p>
<p>I have seen very fine specimens of Talc brought from Nepal as
a medicine; but I have no information concerning the place where
it is found.</p>
<p>On the banks of the Gandaki, at Muktanath, is a precipice,
from which the river is supposed to wash the Salagrams or black
stones, which are considered by the Hindus as representatives of
several of their deities, and which are the most common objects
of worship in Bengal, where images are scarce.&nbsp; They are of
various kinds, and accordingly represent different deities.&nbsp;
Pilgrims, who have been at the place, say, that the stones are
found partly in the precipice, and partly in the bed of the
river, where it has washed down the earth.&nbsp; On account of
its containing these stones, this branch of the river is usually
called the Salagrami, and the channel every where below
Muktinath, until it reaches the plain of India at Sivapur, <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>abounds in these stones.&nbsp; All the Salagrams consist
of carbonate of lime, and are in general quite black, but a few
have white veins.&nbsp; Their colour is probably owing to some
metallic impregnation, which also occasions their great specific
weight.&nbsp; They rarely exceed the size of an orange, and they
are rounded, I suppose, by the action of water.&nbsp; Most of
them are what naturalists call petrifactions, and by far the most
common are Ammonites, half imbedded in a ball of stone, exactly
of the same nature with the petrified animal.&nbsp; Others, which
are reckoned the most valuable, are balls containing a cavity
formed by an Ammonite, that has afterwards decayed, and left only
its impression, or they are what Wallerius calls <i>Typolithi
Ammonitarum</i>.&nbsp; The Ammonites or their impressions are
called the Chakras or wheels of the Salagrams, but are sometimes
wanting.&nbsp; The stone is then a mere ball without any mark of
animal exuvi&aelig;.&nbsp; Some balls have no external opening,
and yet by rubbing away a portion of one of their sides, the
hollow wheel (<i>chakra</i>) is discovered.&nbsp; Such Salagrams
are reckoned very valuable.</p>
<p>In many parts of these mountains, the substance called
<i>Silajit</i> exudes from rocks.&nbsp; I have not yet satisfied
myself concerning its nature; but intend hereafter to treat the
subject fully, when I describe the natural productions of Behar,
where I had an opportunity of collecting it, as it came from the
rock.</p>
<p>The valley of Nepal Proper, which contains Kathmandu, or, as
many call it, Kathmaro, Lalita Patan, and Bhatgang, is the
largest in the dominions of Gorkha, and in this plain there is
not naturally a single stone of any considerable size.&nbsp; The
whole, so far as man has penetrated, consists of what is called
alluvial matter, covered by soil.&nbsp; In some places the
alluvial matter consists of thick beds of fine gravel and sand,
much of <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>which is micaceous.&nbsp; Among these
beds are found concretions of the same materials, united into
balls, about the size and shape of a turkey&rsquo;s egg.&nbsp; At
one end these are generally perforated with a small hole, and
some, but not all of them, are hollow.&nbsp; The Newars call them
Dungoda; but can give no account of their formation, nor did I
observe any thing that could lead to an explanation.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the alluvial matter consists of a
blackish substance resembling clay.&nbsp; It seems to approach
nearer to the nature of turf than any thing with which I am
acquainted, and I have no doubt is of vegetable origin.&nbsp; It
is called Koncha by the Newars, who dig out large quantities, and
apply it to their fields as a manure.&nbsp; The beds, in which it
is disposed, are often very thick and extensive; and it is always
much intermixed with leaves, bits of stick, fruits, and other
vegetable exuvi&aelig;, the produce of plants, similar to those
now growing on the neighbouring hills.</p>
<p>The various rivers that pass through the above-mentioned
Koncha, have washed from its strata another harder and blacker
substance, but still having so strong a resemblance, that it is
called <i>Ha Koncha</i>.&nbsp; This is most commonly found in the
channels of the rivers, and by the natives is supposed to be
decayed charcoal; but the great size of some of the masses seems
to me incompatible with the truth of this opinion.</p>
<p>A kind of blue martial earth, the earthy blue iron ore of
mineralogists, by the Newars called Ong Shigulay, is also found
commonly intermixed with the Koncha.&nbsp; It is never in large
masses, and, in my opinion, has derived its origin from some
vegetable substance that has been gradually impregnated with
iron.&nbsp; Cones of the pine may be traced in all stages, from
those retaining a half of their vegetable nature, to those <!--
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>entirely converted into martial earth, and only
distinguishable by their shape as having once been vegetable
productions.&nbsp; The half-formed specimen that I procured is a
cone of the <i>Pinus strobus</i>; but the more common ones are
exuvi&aelig; of the <i>Pinus longifolia</i>.</p>
<p>In the alluvial matter of the plain of Nepal are also found
large strata of clay, fit for the potter and brickmaker.</p>
<p>The greater part of the mountains which enclose the valley of
Nepal consists of grey granite, of which the surface is very much
decayed wherever it has been exposed to the air.&nbsp; On the
south side of Chandangiri, about four miles west from Pharphing,
is a very large stratum of fine white sand, which the Parbatiyas
call <i>Seta mati</i>, or white earth.&nbsp; It seems to me to be
nothing more than decayed granite; and I think it probable, that
the sandstone found on Sambhu, and the neighbouring hill towards
Hilchuck, is composed of this granitic sand reunited into
rock.&nbsp; This sandstone is used in a few buildings, but I have
seen no large blocks, and the difficulty, or impracticability, of
procuring such, has probably occasioned this stone to be in
general neglected.</p>
<p>The stone usually employed in Nepal for building is a rock
containing much lime, which is so impregnated with other matters,
that, though it effervesces strongly with acids, and falls to
pieces in a sufficient quantity of these liquids, yet, by
calcination, it cannot be reduced to quicklime fit for use.&nbsp;
It is disposed in vertical strata, is very fine grained, has a
silky lustre, cuts well, can be procured in large masses, and
powerfully resists the action of the weather, so that it is an
excellent material for building.</p>
<p>Limestone is so scarce, that clay is the only mortar used by
the natives.&nbsp; We, however, visited a quarry on the mountain
called Nag Arjun, where the people obtain lime for <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>white-washing their houses, and for chewing with
betel.&nbsp; It is a vertical stratum, about two feet wide, and
running parallel with the other strata of the mountain.&nbsp; It
consists of small irregular rhombic crystals, which agree with
the character given by Wallerius of the <i>Spathum
arenarium</i>.</p>
<p>In the lower part of the hills, which borders immediately on
the plain, are found large masses of a hard red clay, considered
by some naturalists, to whom I have shown it, as decomposed
schistus.&nbsp; It is called Lungcha by the Newars, and used by
them for painting the walls of their houses.</p>
<p>The whole of this mountainous region is copiously watered by
limpid streams and springs, and the vegetable productions are of
most remarkable stateliness, beauty, and variety.&nbsp; Except at
the summits of the mountains, the trees are uncommonly large; and
every where, and at all seasons, the earth abounds with the most
beautiful flowers, partly resembling those of India, but still
more those of Europe.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the vegetable productions of the
mountains, so far as they are objects of cultivation.&nbsp; I
shall now mention a few of its spontaneous plants that are
applied to use.</p>
<p>The timber trees consist of various oaks, <a
name="citation83a"></a><a href="#footnote83a"
class="citation">[83a]</a> pines, firs, walnut, <a
name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b"
class="citation">[83b]</a> chesnut, hornbeam, yew, laurels,
hollies, birches, Gordonia, <a name="citation83c"></a><a
href="#footnote83c" class="citation">[83c]</a> Michelias, etc,
most of them species hitherto unnoticed by botanists; but some
exactly the same as in Europe, such as the yew, holly, hornbeam,
walnut, Weymouth pine, (Pinus strobus, W.) and common spruce fir,
(Pinus picea, W.)&nbsp; As, however, the greater part are of
little value, from the <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>inaccessible nature of the country, I
shall only particularize a few kinds.</p>
<p>The <i>Malayagiri</i> is a tree, of which I have only seen a
branch with leaves, and I cannot with any certainty judge what
its botanical affinities may be.&nbsp; It has a pale yellow wood,
with a very agreeable scent, and on this account might be
valuable for fine cabinet work, and might bear the expense of
carriage.</p>
<p>The <i>Tinmue</i>, or <i>Taizbul</i> of Colonel Kirkpatrick,
<a name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a"
class="citation">[84a]</a> is a species of <i>Fagara</i>.&nbsp;
In the mountains of Nepal I have only seen the shrubby kind; but,
on the lower hills, I observed another species, which grows to be
a tree, and which is probably the larger sort alluded to by the
Colonel.</p>
<p>The male <i>Sinkauri</i>, or <i>Silkauli</i> of the mountain
Hindus, is a species of Laurus, which is either the <i>Laurus
japonica</i> of Rumph, <a name="citation84b"></a><a
href="#footnote84b" class="citation">[84b]</a> or approaches very
near to that plant.&nbsp; Both its bark and leaves have a fine
aromatic smell and taste, and this quality in the leaves is
strengthened by drying.&nbsp; They are carried to the low
country, and sold under the name of <i>Tejpat</i>; but the tree
is of a different species from the Tejpat of Ranggapur.</p>
<p>The female Sinkauri, or Silkauli, like the male, is another
tree nearly related to the cinnamon; but its aromatic quality
resides in the bark of the root, which has a very permanent
fragrance, and would probably give a very fine oil.&nbsp; The
specimens brought from the mountains of Morang, appeared to
differ in species from the plant of similar qualities that has
been introduced into Ranggapur from Bhotan.</p>
<p>Both male and female Sinkauli are considered by Colonel <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Kirkpatrick as one species, which he calls
<i>Singrowla</i>, <a name="citation85a"></a><a
href="#footnote85a" class="citation">[85a]</a> probably by a
typographical error.</p>
<p>The <i>Lalchandan</i>, or Red Sandal, is a timber tree, the
foliage and appearance of which have some resemblance to the
Laurels.&nbsp; It seems to be a fine timber for the cabinetmaker,
but has little smell, and is not the Red Sanders or Sandal of the
shops.</p>
<p>The <i>Siedburrooa</i>, mentioned by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b"
class="citation">[85b]</a> as the plant from which the Nepalese
make paper, is a species of Daphne, very nearly allied to that
which botanists call <i>odora</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Karphul</i>, mentioned also by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c"
class="citation">[85c]</a> as a small stone fruit, resembling a
cherry, is a species of <i>Myrica</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Jumne mundroo</i> of Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation85d"></a><a href="#footnote85d"
class="citation">[85d]</a> I consider as a species of
<i>Leontice</i>, although it is a small tree, and has strong
affinities with the <i>Berberis</i>.&nbsp; Its leaves are
pinnated; but each division, as the Colonel notices, has a strong
resemblance to the leaves of the holly.</p>
<p>The <i>Chootraphul</i> of Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation85e"></a><a href="#footnote85e"
class="citation">[85e]</a> is, in fact, a species of barberry, to
which the Colonel compares it.</p>
<p>There are two species of the <i>Chirata</i>, a bitter herb,
much and deservedly used by the Hindu physicians in slow febrile
diseases, as strengthening the stomach.&nbsp; The smaller is the
one most in request.&nbsp; I have not seen its flowers, but the
appearance of the herb agrees with some short notices in
manuscript, with which I was favoured by Dr Roxburgh, of the
plant sent to him as the Chirata, and which he considers as a
species of gentian.&nbsp; The larger Chirata is a species of
<i>Swertia</i>, but approaches nearer in appearance to the common
Gentian of the shops than to any other plant that I know.&nbsp;
Its root, <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>especially, has a great resemblance,
and might probably be a good substitute, were not the herb of the
smaller Chirata a better medicine.&nbsp; Both species, however,
approach so near to each other, that they are often sold
indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The dried scales of a tuberous root are imported from these
mountains into the Company&rsquo;s territory, and the druggists
there call them <i>Kshir kangkri</i> or <i>Titipiralu</i>.&nbsp;
Some people of the mountains, whom I employed, brought me the
living bulbs, certainly of the same kind, and these had young
stems then very thriving, but which soon withered from the
heat.&nbsp; They had every appearance of being a species of
<i>Lilium</i>, and the people who brought them said, that they
were the <i>Titipiralu</i>, while the <i>Kshir kangkri</i>,
according to them, is a plant of the cucurbitaceous tribe.&nbsp;
Other hill people, however, brought for the Titipiralu a species
of <i>Pancratium</i>, which I cannot trace in the works of
botanists; but it has a great resemblance to the <i>Pancratium
maritimum</i>.&nbsp; This is certainly not the plant sold by the
druggists of Nathpur.</p>
<p>The same druggists gave me a medicine which they called
<i>Jainti</i> or <i>Bhutkes</i>.&nbsp; Some of the hill people
said, that it grows among the mosses, on large stones, on the
higher mountains, and is evidently the lower part of the stems of
one of the <i>orchides</i> of that kind of <i>epidendra</i>,
which have an erect stem, many of which, I know, grow in Nepal in
such situations.&nbsp; Others of the mountaineers alleged that
this was not the true Bhutkes, or Bhutkesar, which they say
differs from the Jainti; and, in fact, they brought me from the
snowy mountains a very different plant, which they called
<i>Bhutkesar</i>.</p>
<p><i>Singgiya Bikh</i>, or <i>Bish</i>, is a plant much
celebrated among the mountaineers.&nbsp; The plant was brought to
me in flower, but was entirely male, nor did I see the fruit,
which is said to be a berry.&nbsp; So far as I can judge from
these circumstances, I <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>suppose that it is a species of
<i>Smilax</i>, with ternate leaves.&nbsp; To pass over several of
its qualities that are marvellous, the root, which resembles a
yam, is said to be a violent poison.&nbsp; The berries also are
said to be deleterious, but, when applied externally, are
considered as a cure for the swelling of the throat, which
resembles the goitre of the Swiss, and is very common among the
mountaineers.</p>
<p>The <i>Jhul</i> is imported by the druggists of the
Company&rsquo;s territory, and what was brought as such to me,
consisted of four kinds of Lichen, intermixed with some
straggling Jungermannias.&nbsp; By far the greater part, however,
of the Jhul consisted of two kinds of Lichen, the furfuraceus,
and one very like the farinaceus.&nbsp; These grow on stones
among the mountains.</p>
<p>With respect to the breadth of this mountainous region, there
is reason to think, from the observations of Colonel Crawford,
that, immediately north and east from Kathmandu, the horizontal
direct extent may be from thirty to forty British miles; but
farther west, the breadth of this region probably exceeds that
extent.&nbsp; I have, however, no solid grounds for judging; as
days&rsquo; journies, given by travellers on routes, in such a
country, can give but a very imperfect notion of horizontal
distance.</p>
<p>The alpine region belonging to the chiefs of Gorkha, which
bounds the mountainous district on the north, is probably of
nearly an equal breadth; that is to say, over a space of thirty
or forty miles from north to south, there are scattered immense
peaks covered with perpetual snow, before we reach the passes at
the boundary of Thibet, where almost the whole country is subject
to everlasting winter.&nbsp; Between these scattered peaks there
are narrow vallies, some of which admit of <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>cultivation,
and, being of the same elevation with the higher parts of the
mountainous region, admit of similar productions.</p>
<p>It is indeed said by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a> that, in the alpine vallies occupied
by the Limbus, there is raised a kind of rice called
<i>Takmaro</i>, which he thinks may be probably found to answer
in the climate and soil of England.&nbsp; Whether or not this
Takmaro may be the same with the grain called <i>Uya</i>, which
will be farther mentioned in the account of <i>Malebum</i>, I
cannot take upon myself to determine, although I think it
probable, from the situation in which both are said to grow, that
Uya and Takmaro are two names for the same grain.&nbsp; In this
case the grain may probably be rye, although this also is
uncertain.</p>
<p>By far the greatest part, however, of the Alpine region,
consists of immense rocks, rising into sharp peaks, and the most
tremendous precipices, wherever not perpendicular, covered with
perpetual snow, and almost constantly involved in clouds.&nbsp;
No means for ascertaining the height of the central, and probably
the highest peaks of Emodus, have come to my knowledge; but,
while at Kathmandu, Colonel Crawford had an opportunity of
observing the altitude of several of the detached peaks, the
situations of which will be seen from the accompanying map,
copied from one of this excellent geographer. <a
name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a>&nbsp; The accompanying table also will
give the result of his estimate of the height of these peaks
above the valley of Nepal.&nbsp; In the five wooden plates, taken
from drawings by Colonel Crawford, a view of these mountains from
Oba Mohisyu, in the valley of Nepal is represented, and will give
an idea of their appearance, as well as that of the valley of
Nepal itself, although <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>a better judgment may be formed of
this from the two copperplates that will be afterwards
mentioned.</p>
<p>The southern face of these alps differs very much from those
of Switzerland; for the rains being periodical, and falling in
the hottest season of the year, the snow continues almost always
stationary.&nbsp; It is only the few showers that happen in
winter, and the vapours from condensed clouds, that dissolve in
the beginning of summer, and occasion a small swell in the
rivers, which spring from the south side of these alps.</p>
<p>The country on the north side of these lofty peaks, so far as
I can learn, more resembles Europe.&nbsp; It is exceedingly high
and bare, and is far from being mountainous.&nbsp; The rains,
however, are not periodical, and the greatest falls happen in
summer, so that, although several Indian rivers come from thence,
they do not swell much by the melting of snow in the heats of
spring.</p>
<p>The ridge of snowy alps, although it would appear to wind very
much, has few interruptions, and, in most places, is said to be
totally insuperable.&nbsp; Several rivers that arise in Thibet
pass through among its peaks, but amidst such tremendous
precipices, and by such narrow gaps, that these openings are in
general totally impracticable.&nbsp; By far the widest is on the
Arun, the chief branch of the Kosi, where Maingmo on the west,
and Mirgu on the east, leave a very wide opening occupied by
mountains of a moderate height, and which admit of
cultivation.&nbsp; Even there, however, the Arun is so hid among
precipices, that it is approachable in only a few places, where
there are passes of the utmost difficulty.&nbsp; Again, behind
this opening in the snowy ridge, at a considerable distance
farther north, is another range of hills, not so high and broken
as the immense peaks of Emodus, but still so elevated as to be
totally <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>impassable in winter, owing to the
depth of snow; for the road is said to be tolerable, that is, it
will admit of cattle carrying loads.&nbsp; Somewhat similar seems
in general to be the nature of the other few passages through
these alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is about these passages chiefly, and especially beyond
Maingmo and Mirgu, that there is the greatest extent of the
alpine pastures, which I have already mentioned; but in every
part, bordering on the perpetual snow, these occur more or
less.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a> thinks, that there
are two distinct ranges of Emodus or Himaleh; the lower of which,
separating Nepal from Thibet, is only streaked with snow, while
the highest separates Kuchar, or the lower Bhotan, from
Thibet.&nbsp; He also thought, that, from the summit of the Lama
Dangra hills above Chisapani, he saw the highest ridge.&nbsp;
Now, in the maps which I obtained from the natives, three ridges
may in some measure be traced, as proceeding from about the lake
Manasarawar, which may be considered as the centre of
Emodus.&nbsp; The summits of even the most southern of these
ridges, which is probably the lowest, are not covered with mere
patches of snow, as Colonel Kirkpatrick seems to have thought,
but on them the snow is perennial to a very great extent.</p>
<p>The most northern ridge, which is probably the highest, as it
is nowhere penetrated by rivers, approaches Hindustan only at the
lake Manasarawar, where the remarkable peak called Kailasa may be
considered as its centre.&nbsp; This peak may perhaps be visible
from the southward, although there exists no certainty of its
being so; but the portions of this ridge, which extend west and
east from Kailasa, bordering on <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the north,
the upper part of the Indus, and Brahmaputra rivers, are
certainly invisible from every part of Hindustan, and very little
is known concerning them.</p>
<p>The middle ridge of Himaleh, which separates Thibet from
Hindustan, taking this word in its most extended sense as
including Kasmir, the dominions of Gorkha, etc. extends probably
to the Chinese Sea along the northern frontier of the provinces
of Quangsi and Quantong, lowering gradually as it advances to the
east.&nbsp; Although, so far as connected with Hindustan, it is
of enormous height, yet it is perforated by many rivers, such as
the Indus, Sutluj or Satrudra, Karanali or Sarayu, Gandaki, Arun,
Brahmaputra, etc.</p>
<p>Mr Colebrooke, indeed, <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a> doubts of any rivers
crossing this chain; for he says, &ldquo;It is presumable that
all the tributary streams of the Ganges, including the Sarayu,
(whether its alleged source in the Manasarawar lake be credited
or discredited,) and the Yamuna, rise on the southern side of the
Himaliya;&rdquo; and again he says, &ldquo;From the western side
of the mountains, after the range, taking a sweep to the north,
assumes a new direction in the line of the meridian, arise
streams tributary to the Indus, or perhaps the Indus
itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this I would remark, that all the rivers
I have enumerated, no doubt, arise from Thibet, and penetrate
this chain.&nbsp; If, indeed, the Sarayu, or rather Karnali,
arises from the lake Manasarawar, which is undoubtedly on the
north side of the Himaleh ridge, how could Mr Colebrooke&rsquo;s
position be maintained?&nbsp; He is also probably wrong in
supposing that the central Himaliya ridge bends to the
north.&nbsp; There is rather reason to think that it passes
straight west, after it is penetrated by the Indus, and <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>reaches to the Hindoo Coosh of the Honourable Mr
Elphinston; while it is the western extremity of the northern
ridge, first mentioned, that turns to the north, and separates
Samarkhand and Bokhara from Kashgar.&nbsp; These rivers, which
penetrate the central Himaliya ridge, do not appear to me to
arise from any remarkable ridge of mountains, but spring from
detached eminences on the elevated country of Thibet, and pass
through interruptions or chasms in the central ridge of
Emodus.&nbsp; It is very possible, that Colonel Kirkpatrick saw
this ridge from Lama Dangra; but I am very doubtful, whether any
part of it is visible from the plains of Hindustan; or, at least,
that any of the more distinguished peaks visible from thence
belong to it.&nbsp; All the peaks measured by Colonel Crawford
were, no doubt, to the southward of the central ridge, and I
suspect that all the snow-clad mountains visible from the plains,
like those seen by Colonel Crawford, are either detached peaks,
or belong to the southern ridge.</p>
<p>There is also reason to think, that the peak measured by
Lieutenant Web, and which was one appearing conspicuous from the
plains of Rohilkhand, <a name="citation92a"></a><a
href="#footnote92a" class="citation">[92a]</a> is that laid down
by Mr Arrowsmith, about 40 miles south from Litighat, that is,
from the central chain, and must therefore be near the southern
edge of the alpine region.&nbsp; Contrary, therefore, to the
opinion of Mr Colebrooke, <a name="citation92b"></a><a
href="#footnote92b" class="citation">[92b]</a> I think it very
much to be doubted, whether the snowy mountains, visible from
Rohilkhand, are the highest ground between the level plains of
India, and the elevated regions of southern Tartary, by which I
presume he means Thibet.</p>
<p>The third or southern ridge forms the southern boundary of
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>the alpine region above described.&nbsp; In many parts,
the whole space between this and the central ridge is thickly
covered with immense peaks, so as to leave no separation between
the ridges; but in other parts, there exists an intermediate,
more level, and habitable portion, interposed between the central
ridge and the southern peaks, which in these parts form a very
distinct ridge.&nbsp; This is particularly the case in the Chamba
country, towards Kasmir, in the Taklakhar country on the Karnali,
and in the Kirata country on the Arun, as will be afterwards
described.</p>
<p>Of the productions of this part I shall now proceed to treat,
confining myself to those of the southern face, where there are
but a very few of the cattle, (Bos grunniens,) whose tails form
the Chaungri of India, and the badges by which the Turkish
Bashaws are distinguished; nor are there any of the goats which
produce the fine wool from whence the shawls are made; nor are
there mines of gold, nor, one excepted, of salt, nor of
borax.&nbsp; All these, so far as I can learn, are almost
entirely the produce of the country beyond the alps.</p>
<p>An account of the Chandra or shawl-wool goat has been given by
Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation93"></a><a
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a> who suspects it to
be rather scarce, even in Thibet, since it is not without the
greatest difficulty that a perfect male of this species can be
procured, owing to the jealous vigilance employed by the
Thibetians to prevent their being conveyed into foreign
countries.&nbsp; The editor, in a note, thinks this opinion
unfounded, because Captain Turner brought several of these
animals from Thibet to Bengal, from whence he sent a few to
England.&nbsp; I do not see that the reasoning of either Colonel
Kirkpatrick, or his editor, is here conclusive.&nbsp; If the
people of Thibet are jealous, the <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>difficulty of
procuring a perfect male for exportation can be no proof of the
species being scarce.&nbsp; Neither can Captain Turner&rsquo;s
having been allowed to bring several of these animals to Bengal
be considered as a proof of the want of jealousy.&nbsp; A great
many wethers of this breed are annually brought to market at
Kathmandu, and may be readily procured, nor does it appear that
those brought by Captain Turner were entire males.&nbsp; Those
remaining in the Governor General&rsquo;s park in 1803 were all
wethers.&nbsp; That both entire males and females may be
procured, we know from the exertions of Mr Moorcroft; but that
the people of Thibet are very jealous in preserving the monopoly,
I have been assured by that gentleman, as well as by the people
of Nepal.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned, that I believe sulphur, and perhaps
talc, are found in these alpine regions, and there can be no
doubt that they abound with Mica (<i>Abrak</i>) in large plates,
and in rock crystal (<i>Belor</i>) of a large size.&nbsp; It is
probably in reference to this mineral, that some parts of this
great alpine chain, towards the north-west, has been named Belor
Tag, although Mr Elphinston gives another derivation, and changes
the final <i>r</i> into a <i>t</i>, in order to accommodate the
word to his meaning, which may, however, be quite correct.&nbsp;
Besides these mineral productions, the alpine region has several
metallic veins, especially lead and zinc, or tutenague.</p>
<p>The most valuable production of the southern face of these
mountains is the animal which produces musk, of which vast
numbers are annually killed.&nbsp; The only other large animal
found there is a kind of wild sheep of great size.&nbsp; The
accounts which I have received concerning it are very imperfect,
and I have only seen one skin, which was in a very bad state of
preservation.&nbsp; It may possibly be the same animal that our
zoologists have described by the name of <i>Argali</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>These frigid regions are the constant abode of two of
the finest birds that are known, the Manal <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a> and Damphiya. <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a>&nbsp; To me both seem evidently to
have the closest affinity with each other, in size, manners, and
form, and the females of the two species are not easily
distinguishable; yet the former, (Meleagris satyra, L.) by the
best ornithologists, has been most unaccountably classed with the
turkey, and the latter (Phasianus Impeyanus) with the pheasant,
to which the resemblance is very trifling.</p>
<p>Along with these two fine birds, according to Colonel
Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation95c"></a><a href="#footnote95c"
class="citation">[95c]</a> is found the <i>Chakor</i>, or
<i>Chiukoar</i>, according to his orthography.&nbsp; He states,
that this bird &ldquo;is well known to the Europeans in India by
the name of fire-eater.&nbsp; It is a species of partridge,
(<i>Perdix rufa</i>,) and derives its English name from its
reputed power of swallowing fire.&nbsp; The fact, according to
the people of Nepal, is that in the season of love, this bird is
remarkably fond of red or <i>chean</i> (Cayenne) pepper, after
eating two or three capsules of which, it will eat a red coal if
offered to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This account of the Nepalese deserves
no credit; for, in its native frozen mountains, where is the
Chakor to procure Capsicum or Cayenne pepper? and I know that the
birds will pick at sparks of fire, where no capsicum has been
given to them.</p>
<p>The vegetable productions of these mountains are, however, the
greatest object of curiosity, and it is with infinite regret that
I not only have not had it in my power to visit them, but that
the disturbances existing between the two governments, when I was
on the frontier, have prevented me from procuring complete
specimens and seeds of many of the most interesting objects, for
which arrangements had been made, <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>when the
disputes put a stop to communication.&nbsp; While at Nathpur, I
had indeed previously procured young plants of most of the kinds,
but although kept in a very cool house, not one of them resisted
the summer heats.&nbsp; I shall now mention some of the most
remarkable.</p>
<p>The <i>Dhupi</i> is a species of juniper.&nbsp; Its wood has a
beautiful grain, a fine mahogany colour, and a remarkably
pleasant scent, a good deal resembling that of the pencil cedar,
but stronger, and I think more agreeable.&nbsp; Planks of this
are sent to Thibet, from whence they are probably carried to
China.&nbsp; A man, whom I sent from Nathpur to Thibet, in order
to procure plants, says, that the Dhupi grows to be a very large
tree, in which case it would be a valuable acquisition in Europe,
in the northern parts of which it will no doubt thrive.</p>
<p>The <i>Thumuriya Dhupi</i> is another species of juniper,
which is a low bush, like the kind common in the north of
Europe.&nbsp; Its branches and leaves have an agreeable smell,
and are used in fumigations.</p>
<p>The <i>Hingwalka Chhota saral</i>, or small alpine fir, so
strongly resembles the common fir of the south of Europe,
(<i>Pinus picca</i>, W.) that I can perceive no difference in the
foliage; but I have not seen the cones.&nbsp; There is, however,
probably some difference, for it is said never to grow to a
considerable size, and the leaves, if I can trust to memory, have
a much more agreeable smell than those of the common fir.</p>
<p>The <i>Hingwalka bara Saral</i>, or large alpine fir, is in
fact the yew tree; and although I have seen it in all its stages,
I can perceive no very essential difference between it and the
tree of Europe.&nbsp; Its leaves, however, are rather larger, and
bent, (<i>falcata</i>.)&nbsp; Like the yew in the north of
Europe, it grows to a great size.</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>The <i>Bhuryapatra</i> or <i>Bhurjapatra</i> is a
species of birch, the bark of which resembles that of the tree
common in Europe, in being separable into fine smooth layers; but
these are of a fine chesnut colour.&nbsp; This bark is imported
into the low country in considerable quantity, and is used both
in the religious ceremonies of the Hindus, and for constructing
the flexible tubes with which the natives smoke tobacco.</p>
<p>The <i>Sanpati</i> is a small Rhododendron, which has a
considerable affinity with the kinds described in the
Encyclop&eacute;die by the names of R. linearifolium and
ferrugineum.&nbsp; It is a shrub much like our sweet gale in
Europe, and its leaves are very odorous, and, even when dried,
retain their fragrance.&nbsp; It is used in fumigations, and sent
to the low country.</p>
<p>The <i>Bhairopati</i>, although I have not seen the flower,
is, I have no doubt, another similar species of the Rhododendron,
which has a great resemblance to the kind called
Cham&aelig;cistus.&nbsp; Its qualities are similar to those of
the former, but it is less fragrant.&nbsp; The man whom I sent to
Thibet brought, as the <i>Bhairopati</i>, a totally different
plant, of which the specimens so strongly resemble branches of
the Cypressus sempervirens meta convoluta, that I should have no
doubt of its being this plant, were it not that the man describes
it as a shrub, and that its dried leaves have a disagreeable
sulphurous smell.&nbsp; It is, however, the Rhododendron which is
always sold in the shops of Hindustan as the
<i>Bhairopati</i>.</p>
<p>There seems to be some difficulty in fixing the nomenclature
of the <i>Jatamangsi</i>, a plant celebrated among the natives as
a perfume, and of which large quantities are sent from these Alps
to the plains of India.&nbsp; What I procured at the shops in
Nathpur, and recently imported from the Alps, was the species of
Valerian described by Dr Roxburgh in the Asiatick Researches, and
supposed by Sir William Jones to be the <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>spikenard of
the ancients.&nbsp; As there can be no disputing about taste, I
cannot take upon myself to say how far the encomiums bestowed on
the fragrance of the spikenard are applicable to this valerian;
and the native women, no doubt, consider the smell very
agreeable, because most of such as can afford it use oil
impregnated with this root for perfuming their hair.&nbsp; All I
can say is, that, if this root was the spikenard of the Roman
ladies, their lovers must have had a very different taste from
the youth of modern Europe.&nbsp; A still greater difficulty
attends the nomenclature of the <i>Jatamangsi</i>.&nbsp; A person
whom I employed to bring me the growing plant from the mountains,
produced a root totally different from the former.&nbsp; It
strongly resembled the root of the Anthamantha meum; but when
fresh had an uncommonly fragrant smell.&nbsp; From the appearance
of the leaves, I have no doubt that it is an umbelliferous
plant.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the doubts that exist about the plant
called <i>Bhutkesar</i>, which is imported from the mountains,
and used as a medicine.&nbsp; What was brought to me from the
snowy mountains was a thick woody root, on the top of which were
many stiff bristles, and from among these the young leaves were
shooting.&nbsp; These were three times divided into three, and
resembled these of a Thalictrum, of which I know there are
several species in the lower mountains of Nepal.</p>
<p>The term <i>Bish</i> or <i>Bikh</i>, according to the
pronunciation of the same letters on the plains, and in the
mountains, is applied to four different plants with tuberous
roots, all in great request.&nbsp; I have already mentioned the
<i>Singgiya Bish</i>, as found on the lower mountains and hills,
and supposed it to be a species of Smilax.&nbsp; The others have
not the smallest resemblance to it, but are so strongly marked by
a resemblance to each other, that I have no doubt of their all
belonging to the same <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>genus, although I have only seen the
flower and fruit of one.&nbsp; This is called <i>Bishma</i> or
<i>Bikhma</i>, and seems to me to differ little in botanical
characters from the <i>Caltha</i> of Europe.&nbsp; The
<i>Bishma</i> or <i>Bikhma</i> is also, I believe, called
<i>Mitha</i>, although I am not certain but that this name may be
also given to the following species, which deserves the most
serious attention, as the <i>Bikhma</i> is used in medicine, is a
strong bitter, very powerful in the cure of fevers, while the
plant that will be next mentioned is one of the most virulent
poisons.</p>
<p>This dreadful root, of which large quantities are annually
imported, is equally fatal when taken into the stomach, and
applied to wounds, and is in universal use throughout India for
poisoning arrows; and there is too much reason to suspect, for
the worst of purposes.&nbsp; Its importation would indeed seem to
require the attention of the magistrate.&nbsp; The Gorkhalese
pretend, that it is one of their principal securities against
invasion from the low countries; and that they could so infect
all the waters on the route by which an enemy was advancing, as
to occasion his certain destruction.&nbsp; In case of such an
attempt, the invaders ought, no doubt, to be on their guard; but
the country abounds so in springs, that might be soon cleared, as
to render such a means of defence totally ineffectual, were the
enemy aware of the circumstance.&nbsp; This poisonous species is
called <i>Bish</i>, <i>Bikh</i>, and <i>Hodoya Bish</i> or
<i>Bikh</i>, nor am I certain whether the <i>Mitha</i> ought to
be referred to it, or to the foregoing kind.</p>
<p>The <i>Nirbishi</i> or <i>Nirbikhi</i> is another plant of the
same genus, and, like the first kind, has no deleterious
qualities, but is used in medicine.&nbsp; The President of the
Asiatick Society, in a note annexed to Dr Roxburgh&rsquo;s
account of the Zedoary, gives the <i>Nirbisha</i> or
<i>Nirbishi</i> as a Sangskrita or Hindwi name of that plant,
which has not the smallest resemblance to the <i>Nirbishi
</i><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>of the Indian Alps.&nbsp; In fact,
the nomenclature of the <i>materia medica</i> among the Hindus,
so far as I can learn, is miserably defective, and can scarcely
fail to be productive of most dangerous mistakes in the practice
of medicine.&nbsp; For instance, the man whom I sent to Thibet
for plants brought, as the species which produces the poison,
that which was first brought to me as the <i>Nirbishi</i>, or
kind used in medicine.</p>
<p>The <i>Padam chhal</i> is a plant with a thick cylindrical
root, that is used in medicine, and brought to the low country
for that purpose.&nbsp; The specimen that I procured had one
large heart-shaped rough leaf, and had somewhat the appearance of
an Anemone.</p>
<p>The <i>Kutki</i> is another officinal plant with a woody root,
and a stem containing many alternate leaves, toothed on the
edges, and shaped like a spathula.&nbsp; It has much the
appearance of a saxifrage.&nbsp; The roots are brought for
sale.</p>
<p>The <i>Brim</i> appears to be one of the orchides, and has a
root used in medicine.</p>

Forms of Proceeding.&mdash;Punishments.&mdash;Provincial
Government.&mdash;Revenue and Endowments.&mdash;Officers of
State.&mdash;Military Establishment.&mdash;Differences in the
parts west from the River Kali.&mdash;Revenue and Civil
Establishment.&mdash;Military Establishment.</p>
<p>Having thus described, in a general manner, the inhabitants
and country of the territory subject to the chief of Gorkha, I
shall now give a similar view of the form of government which
existed under the petty chiefs, to whom it was formerly subject,
and of the changes which have been introduced since its union
under one head.</p>
<p>I shall only premise a very just observation of Colonel
Kirkpatrick, who says, <a name="citation101"></a><a
href="#footnote101" class="citation">[101]</a> &ldquo;that the
government, taking its colour, for the most part, from the
character and temporary views of the ruling individual, must
necessarily be of too fugitive a nature to admit of any
delineation equally applicable to all periods and
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may serve to explain many
differences between his account and mine, without supposing the
information received by either to be erroneous.</p>
<p>The management of affairs in all the petty states was in <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>many points the same, and differed chiefly in the names
applied to similar officers, and in the nature of the military
establishment in the two countries to the east and west of the
river Kali.&nbsp; I have already mentioned, that in the former
the Hindu rules of purity and law had been established with much
less rigour than in the latter; but, in other points, such as the
names of officers, and the form of government, the eastern parts
followed more nearly the ancient Hindu system, while the western
more fully imitated the Muhammedans.</p>
<p>In the parts east of the Kali, for each small territory or
manor called a Gang, or, where these were small, for every two or
three, there was an officer called an Umra Mokudum or Mahato, and
over from ten to twenty gangs there was a higher officer named
Desali or Chaudhuri, assisted by a Mujumdar or accountant.&nbsp;
In cases of disputes or petty offences, one or other of these
officers, called a kind of jury, (Pangchayit,) and endeavoured to
settle the affair, so as to avoid farther trouble; but, if one or
other of the parties was dissatisfied, he might go to the
Raja&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; There an officer, called Bichari in the
east, and Darogah in the west, received an account of the affair
from the parties, or from the inferior officers, and endeavoured
to settle it.&nbsp; If, however, the cause was important, or
required severe punishment, or if either of the parties insisted
on it, the matter was referred by the Bichari to the minister of
the Raja, called Karyi in the east, and Vazir in the west, either
verbally or by petition, according to its importance.&nbsp; The
minister communicated the affair to the Raja, who ordered the
Bichari to try it by a Pangchayit.&nbsp; This kind of jury made a
report, saying, that the parties were guilty of such or such a
crime.&nbsp; The Raja then ordered whatever punishment he thought
fit, but, in doing so, usually consulted an officer called
Dharm&rsquo;adhikar, or owner of justice, who pointed out the
law.</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>The criminal in the east might appeal from even the
Raja&rsquo;s decision, to the court called Bharadar, consisting
of all the chief officers of government; but in the west, no such
court, I believe, existed.&nbsp; Oaths were seldom
administered.&nbsp; If the parties, however, insisted on this
form, the Haribangsa, a part of the Mahabharat, was put into the
witness&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Ordeals were seldom used, until the
Gorkha family seized the government, since which they have become
very frequent.</p>
<p>There were five severe punishments: 1<i>st</i>, confiscation
of the whole estate; 2<i>dly</i>, banishment of the whole family;
3<i>dly</i>, degradation of the whole family by delivering the
members to the lowest tribes; 4<i>thly</i>, maiming the limbs;
5<i>thly</i>, death by cutting the throat.</p>
<p>The people of Gorkha have introduced other capital
punishments, hanging and flaying alive.&nbsp; Women, as in all
Hindu governments, are never put to death; but the punishments
inflicted on them are abundantly severe.&nbsp; The most common is
the cutting off their noses.&nbsp; Even those of considerable
rank are tortured, by being smoked in a small chamber with the
suffocating fumes of burning capsicum, and by having their
private parts stuffed with this acrid substance.</p>
<p>There were two kinds of fines; Prayaschitta for the neglect of
ceremonies, and those inflicted as punishments for crimes.&nbsp;
The latter went to the Raja, and do so still.&nbsp; The former
went to the Dharm&rsquo;adhikar, or chancellor; but having been
enormously multiplied since the Gorkha government, their amount
is divided into eight shares, of which the Raja takes one, the
collector (Gomashtash) one, the Dharm&rsquo;adhikar one, and one
goes to each of five families of Brahmans, named Pangre, Pantha,
Arjal, Khanal, and Agnidanda.&nbsp; These families divide their
shares equally among their members, who have multiplied
exceedingly.&nbsp; Besides the fine, all <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>delinquents
in matters of ceremony are compelled to entertain a certain
number of these five families; the two first fattening on the
wicked of the country west from the Narayani; and the other three
on those east from that river.&nbsp; The number to be fed is
restricted by the sentence, and the criminal may select those to
whom he gives the entertainment, in any manner he pleases,
confining himself strictly to the families entitled to
participate.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick, when he visited the country, thought <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> that the government, on the whole,
afforded considerable protection to foreign merchants, rendering
them in all cases as strict and prompt justice, as the imperfect
nature of its general polity will admit.&nbsp; This, perhaps, is
not saying much, as in the subsequent page he mentions, that the
trade between Nepal and Thibet, the principal one in the country,
is subject to very enormous, and at all times arbitrary
exactions.&nbsp; In fact, all other branches of commerce, so far
as I could judge, were in a state of decay, owing partly to these
exactions, and partly to the recovery of debts being now very
much neglected in the courts of justice, which seems to be one of
the causes of the increase of trials by ordeal.&nbsp; A poor
creditor, in general, has no resource against a powerful debtor,
except sitting Dherna on him; and unless the creditor be a
Brahman, he may sit long enough before he attract any notice.</p>
<p>Since the government of Gorkha, there has been usually
established a Subah in place of each Raja, and the affairs are
generally conducted by these officers as formerly; so far at
least as relates to form; but they are not allowed to inflict any
of the five severe punishments, without special orders from the
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Raja or court, to whom a report of the case is
made.&nbsp; There are, however, great complaints of injustice,
the Subahs having power to check all complaints.&nbsp; In the
petty states the Raja durst not neglect justice, having no
resource except in his subjects&rsquo; affection.&nbsp; Personal
acts of extreme violence, in contests for power, were overlooked
in the families of the chief; and no attention was paid to punish
assassination, when committed on pretence of revenging injured
honour.</p>
<p>The Subahs having no power of inflicting severe punishment,
few of these officers have with them a Dharm&rsquo;adhikar; but,
where a person of this kind is allowed, he is appointed by the
Dharm&rsquo;adhikar of Kathmandu.&nbsp; At that city there are
now four Bicharis, and these appoint an officer of the same kind
for each Subah.&nbsp; Over the Bicharis of Kathmandu is a chief
called Ditha, who does not try causes, but watches over the
conduct of the court.</p>
<p>The Subah is an officer of revenue, justice, and police, and,
in fact, always farms the whole royal revenue of his
district.&nbsp; He sometimes collects the different branches of
revenue, on his own account, by means of subordinate officers
named Fouzdars, and sometimes farms them to Izaradars.&nbsp; The
land revenue, under the Fouzdars, is collected by Chaudhuris or
Desalis, and other petty officers above mentioned.&nbsp; None of
these offices are in any degree hereditary, nor does there seem
to be any regular system for their payment.&nbsp; Sometimes the
allowances are made in land, sometimes by a <i>per centage</i> on
the rent, and sometimes by monthly wages.&nbsp; The whole seems
to be in a great measure left to the discretion of the Subah,
but, under the name of Khurchah, both he, and every man in
authority under him, takes from his inferiors as much as he
can.</p>
<p>The Subah has under his authority some armed men, and <!--
page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>these are called Seapoys; but they are irregulars, like
the Burkandaj, which are employed by the civil authority in
Bengal.</p>
<p>The amount paid by the Subah forms by no means the whole of
the royal revenue.&nbsp; On a great variety of occasions, besides
the presents that every one must make on approaching the court,
there is levied a Rajangka, which is a kind of income tax that
extends to all ranks, and even to such of the sacred order as
possess free lands.&nbsp; A Rajangka is levied at no fixed
period, but according to the exigencies of the state; and many
districts pay more on this account than the regular revenue,
which has been often almost entirely alienated, by giving the
lands as religious endowments, to various civil officers, and in
military tenure for the support of the army.&nbsp; The Subah does
not collect the Rajangka; an officer for that purpose is
especially sent from the court.</p>
<p>When Colonel Kirkpatrick visited the country, he learned, on
what he considered tolerably good authority, that the revenue
which reached the treasury at Kathmandu never exceeded 3,000,000
of rupees, and fluctuated between that and 2,500,000.&nbsp; The
subsequent addition of territory, although it has increased the
means of supporting a large army, has probably sent little money
to the capital.</p>
<p>The ordinary public revenue, consisting of land-rents,
customs, fines, and mines, in the east, was divided among the
chief, and the principal persons and officers of his family, the
chief for his own expense receiving about two-thirds of the
whole; but, if there was in the family any estate on the plain,
the chief reserved the whole of this for himself, although he
sometimes bestowed part free of revenue for services.&nbsp; About
a third of the revenue that remained, after grants to the civil
and military establishments, was divided as follows: the <!--
page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Chautariya, or chief councillor, always the
Raja&rsquo;s brother in the Indian sense, that is, a near kinsman
in the male line, received one fifth.&nbsp; The Karyi, or man of
business, who was always a near relation of the chief, had an
equal share.&nbsp; The Raja&rsquo;s eldest son, when married, had
as much.&nbsp; The chief&rsquo;s virgin spouse, when she had
children, was allowed as much.&nbsp; The Serdar, or principal
officer, who was not of the chief&rsquo;s family, received
one-tenth.&nbsp; The Jethabura, a councillor, had
one-twentieth.&nbsp; Finally, the Kaliya, or secretary, obtained
as much.&nbsp; All other officers, soldiers, and even most
domestics, were paid in lands, held as long as they performed the
duty, and called Jaygirs, a Persian term.&nbsp; The occupants
either cultivated the lands themselves, or let them as they
pleased.&nbsp; There were, besides, lands appropriated to the
support of some temples, and two kinds of free estates granted in
perpetuity to individuals.&nbsp; The owners of one kind, called
Brittiyas, had no jurisdiction over those living on their
estates, which was also the case with those holding Jaygirs; the
others, called Bitalpas, administered justice to their
vassals.&nbsp; They were all Brahmans, and never were numerous;
but by far the greater part of the lands of both Bitalpas and
Brittiyas have been resumed by the chiefs of Gorkha, in order to
increase the military establishment.&nbsp; In other respects they
have not much altered the constitution.</p>
<p>In consequence of their extended dominions, the princes of
Gorkha have increased the number of the chief officers of state,
and have four Chautariyas, four Karyis, and four Serdars.</p>
<p>When Colonel Kirkpatrick visited the country the twelve chief
officers, according to his orthography, <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a> were reckoned, <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>one
Choutra, four Kajies, four Sirdars, two Khurdars or secretaries,
one Kuppardar or storekeeper, and one Khuzanchee or
treasurer.</p>
<p>These chief officers now form the Bharadar, or great council
of the Raja, which attends him in the Durbar, Rajdani, or palace
to transact business, and which frequently acts without his
presence.&nbsp; It ought to consist of these twelve members; but
some of the places are often vacant, and, at other times, the
persons who hold them have so little influence, that they neglect
or avoid giving their attendance.&nbsp; At other times, again, on
business of the utmost emergency, a kind of assembly of notables
is held, in which men who have neither office, nor any
considerable influence in the government, are allowed to speak
very freely, which seems to be done merely to allow the
discontents of the nation to evaporate, as there is not a vestige
of liberty in the country, nor does the court seem ever to be
controlled by the opinions advanced in these assemblies.</p>
<p>The first rank of councillors is the only one now confined to
the prince&rsquo;s family, and is often given to illegitimate
kinsmen.&nbsp; The Chautariya, who is the nearest relation to the
reigning prince, is always considered as the prime minister,
although he may have little real authority.&nbsp; During our stay
in Nepal, the first Chautariya was a boy, brother to the Raja,
and never appeared except on occasions of ceremony, where he was
exhibited like a puppet, in the same manner as his sovereign.</p>
<p>The office of Karyi should be held by persons only of a few
very distinguished families; but many exceptions have been made
of late, and especially in the instance of Bhim Sen, the present
ruler of the country, who holds no higher office than this, to
which even his birth does not entitle him.</p>
<p>The Serdars are chosen from whatever families the chief thinks
proper; but, in public opinion, the giving the office to <!--
page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>low men, especially if these are entrusted with much
power, is exceedingly offensive.</p>
<p>Every person who has held the office of Chautariya, Karyi, and
Serdar, continues to enjoy the title for life; and, whenever a
man is appointed to one of these dignities, all his brothers
assume the title.</p>
<p>Military officers, named Serdars, frequently are appointed to
command over different portions of the country, and, wherever
they are, have a jurisdiction in all matters over the
Subahs.&nbsp; In particular, their criminal jurisdiction is much
more extensive, as they can condemn to capital punishment,
without any reference to the court, while the Subah requires an
order from thence before he can punish any criminal.&nbsp; Still
more are the Subahs under the authority of the higher officers of
state, the Chautariyas and Karyis, when any of these eight great
officers of state are deputed in command to the provinces.&nbsp;
The Serdars who visit the provinces do not always belong to the
four great officers of this title, who with the four Chautariyas
and four Karyis compose the great council of twelve, which
assists the Raja to govern the nation.&nbsp; These great Serdars,
like the other great officers of state, are occasionally deputed
on high commands; but some Serdars, such as I have before
mentioned, are, in general, stationary in different parts of the
country, and have authority over all the Subahs and civil
officers in their vicinity, although they are properly military
men, for such are the only persons, Brahmans excepted, who are
considered as entitled to any weight in the state.&nbsp; The
Serdar in command at Vijaypur, I understand, receives 7000 rupees
a-year, but out of this he pays his establishment.&nbsp; It is to
these persons that communications from our provincial officers
should be made, as the Subahs are considered as inferior
characters.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>There are thirty-six families of Gorkhalis, who should
hold all the principal offices of government, and, in fact, have
always held the greater part of them.&nbsp; A fuller detail of
the condition and privileges of these families than I procured
may be found in Colonel Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s account. <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; They are divided into three
gradations, and the highest, consisting of six houses, are
considered as having an exclusive right to the office of
Karyi.&nbsp; When I was at Kathmandu, in 1802, by far the most
powerful of these six houses were the Pangres and Viswanaths.</p>
<p>Occasionally a few regulars are sent to act as a guard to the
Subahs, but the Telanggas, or regular troops, are entirely exempt
from the authority of these officers.</p>
<p>The military force among the petty chiefs was always large in
proportion to their means, but consisted of a rabble totally
undisciplined and ill armed, although of good bodily
endowments.&nbsp; Much order has been introduced by the chiefs of
Gorkha, although both in arms and discipline the soldiers are
still very far behind Europeans.&nbsp; In Puraniya I was told,
that, in that vicinity, that is, in the country of the Kiratas,
the lands assigned for the support of the military were given to
the officers commanding companies, who were held bound to give
regular pay to their men; nor have I any reason to doubt that
such a measure has been carried into effect in that vicinity; but
I was assured at Gorakhpur, as also at Kathmandu, that each
individual in the western parts receives his own lands.</p>
<p>Each Subahdar commanding a company now receives 400 or 500
rupees a-year, and 15 khets or fields, each of which is estimated
to produce 100 muris or 234&frac12; Winchester bushels <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>of
grain, of which, if the land is let, he will obtain one-half,
worth almost 72 (71&#8542;) rupees.&nbsp; For every Pati or squad
of from 20 to 25 fuzileers there are one Jumahdar, one Havildar,
and one Amildar.&nbsp; The first of these receives 7 fields of
land, and 200 rupees in money.&nbsp; A major keeps the accounts
of the company, and has Jumahdar&rsquo;s allowances.&nbsp; Each
company has five or six squads, besides officers and music.&nbsp;
The privates have each three fields, and 25 rupees a-year.&nbsp;
Such are the accounts that I received.&nbsp; Those given to
Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation111"></a><a
href="#footnote111" class="citation">[111]</a> differ somewhat,
making the allowance of the superior officers higher, and of the
privates lower, than what I have stated.</p>
<p>Each company has a large band of music, amounting to ten men,
where there are six Patis or squads.&nbsp; These have instruments
of the most hideous noise.&nbsp; Each company has, besides, two
flags, and a regular establishment of artificers, so that the
army may be considered as perfectly well arranged; but the
soldiers are little versed in tactics, and, considering the
strong country that they possess, this would be of less
importance, were they in habits of more prompt obedience, and
more dexterous in the use of their arms; but they do not load
with cartridge.&nbsp; They have all firelocks, but these are not
in the best condition.&nbsp; They do not use the bayonet, but
have all swords, which are, perhaps, better fitted for such a
country, and I believe that the men are dexterous in their
use.&nbsp; They also have in their belt a large knife or dagger,
(Khukri,) which serves as many purposes as that of
Hudibras.&nbsp; It is represented in the uppermost figure of the
plate opposite to page 118, in the work of Colonel
Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; When that <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>gentleman
visited the country, the troops were irregularly clothed, some in
the same company of guards wearing red, some green, and some
blue.&nbsp; When I saw them, this irregularity had been remedied,
and all were in red, each company having, besides, its peculiar
facings; and, although their arms were not clean, they did not
appear so bad as when Colonel Kirkpatrick saw them, as he states
<a name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a> that few of their muskets appeared fit
for service.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Kathmandu, Bhim Sen is said to have
collected 25 companies, and there are probably 15 at Tamsen,
under his father.&nbsp; It is also said, that at each of the
capitals of former petty chiefs there are from one to five
companies; and a large body, perhaps from 20 to 25 companies, is
under old Amar Singha in advance beyond the Yamuna.&nbsp; In the
western parts, the old irregulars, I believe, have been entirely
discarded, or are only called out occasionally in times of actual
hostility, when they are employed to plunder.</p>
<p>In the parts west from the river Kali, almost the whole
revenue, whether on the mountains or plains, being reserved under
the immediate management of the prince, a fuller establishment
was necessary; and that which existed under the petty chiefs,
entirely resembled what is described by the late Mr Grant,
Sereshtahdar of Bengal, as the proper Mogul system.&nbsp; The
actual cultivators, or farmers as they would be termed in
England, only they all occupied very small farms, were called
Zemindars, and were very moderately assessed.&nbsp; In Almora,
(and the other estates did not materially differ,) the rent was
fixed by the Visi, which, on an average, may be taken at 10
Calcutta bigas, or 3-1/5 English acres; but the Visis <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>varied a good deal in size, especially in such as were
exempted from assessment, which were in general much larger than
such as paid it.&nbsp; The extent of 10 bigas for the Visi is
chiefly applicable to the latter.&nbsp; The rent was paid partly
in kind, partly in money.&nbsp; Each Visi in October paid 28 sers
of clean rice, (Calcutta weight,) 4 sers of the pulse called
Urid, and 2 sers of Ghiu or oil: in May it paid 28 sers of wheat,
4 sers of Urid, and 2 of Ghiu: in August it paid one rupee in
money.&nbsp; On each of the two holidays called Dasahara, there
was besides a kid offered to the sovereign for every 10
Visis.&nbsp; The possessions of a convenient number of Zemindars
formed a gram or gang, and one of them held the hereditary office
of Pradhan, entirely analogous to the Umra of the eastern
parts.&nbsp; The Pradhan was allowed a deduction of rent, and
enjoyed some honourable distinctions, and, when the heir was in
any manner incapacitated, a relation was appointed to act for
him.&nbsp; The representations of the other Zemindars or farmers
in the same gram, were usually considered as the most just
criterion of this incapacity.&nbsp; Besides the judicial powers
and the magistracy of his territory, the Pradhan kept an account
of the other tenants, and of their payments and debts to
government, and, receiving what was due, transmitted it to the
collector.&nbsp; He was also an agent for the other Zemindars of
his village, to represent losses which they had suffered, and to
solicit indulgences on the occasion.&nbsp; Over from twenty to
fifty Pradhans was another hereditary officer named Kamin,
analogous to the Desali of the eastern states.&nbsp; He assisted
the Pradhans in settling their accounts, and in obtaining
indulgences on account of peculiar losses; and it was his duty,
in an especial manner, to protect the Zemindars, and to induce
new comers to occupy waste lands.&nbsp; The rents were never
farmed out, but were <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>delivered by the Pradhans to the
messengers of the collector, or Bandari, who received an account
of what was due from the Kanungoe or register, and he made up his
accounts from those forwarded to him by the Pradhans.&nbsp; Where
the lordship was petty, no other officers were necessary; but
where large, the country was divided into pergunahs or taluks,
each managed by an officer removeable at will.&nbsp; In the most
important of these districts, especially towards a weak frontier,
were stationed military officers called Foujdars, who had
authority to determine many small suits without appeal, but
always with the assistance of a Pangchayit.&nbsp; In the less
important stations, the officers managing taluks or pergunahs
were on the hills named Negis, and on the plains Adhikars.&nbsp;
These also decided causes by means of a Pangchayit; but there was
an appeal to the chief&rsquo;s court, in which he sat in person,
assisted by his principal officers, the Darogah or judge, and the
Dharm&rsquo;adhikar or chancellor.&nbsp; These often decided the
cause without a Pangchayit; but this was only when the parties
were obstinate, and would not consent to the use of this kind of
jury.&nbsp; The facts in criminal prosecutions were often
investigated by the inferior officers and Pangchayit on the spot,
and the chief and his chancellor judged from their report, what
punishment was due.&nbsp; The Foujdars, Negis, and Adhikars,
besides their duties as judges, magistrates, and military
guardians of the boundary, which the Foujdars were, received from
the Pradhans all the rents, and, having sold those paid in kind,
remitted the proceeds to the (Bandari) collector, or rather
store-keeper.</p>
<p>About six parts in ten of the whole lands had been alienated
to the Brahmans and temples, nor do I hear any complaint in this
quarter of the present government having invaded this <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>property; but much of the Zemindary lands have been
granted to the soldiers and officers, on the same terms as
towards the east, and the Zemindars of such lands have in a great
measure been left to the discretion of the new occupants, who
have of course raised considerably the rate of rent.&nbsp; In
former times the chiefs received the whole proceeds, and paid
from thence the whole establishment, civil and military.&nbsp; In
comparing the following accounts, therefore, of the states east
and west of the river Kali, particular attention must be paid to
this circumstance.&nbsp; For instance, the revenue of Gorkha has
been stated at 12,000 rupees, and that of Bhajji at 15,000; but
the latter, even in comparison with the former, was altogether
petty, as this 15,000 rupees was the whole sum destined for the
support of the chief and his family, and of his officers,
servants, and soldiers; whereas the 12,000 rupees in Gorkha was
entirely disposable for the personal expense of the chief, and
his children; his kinsmen, and even most of his domestics, as
well as the civil and military establishments, being supported
entirely by land.</p>
<p>In the western parts, the chief civil authority was held by
the Vazir, and the chief military command by the Bukhshi, and
both were appointed by the will of the chief; but of course most
commonly were conferred on his kinsmen, although some families of
Brahmans often interfered.&nbsp; The military were of two
kinds.&nbsp; Part consisted of adventurers from the low country,
the privates receiving usually five rupees a month, and remaining
constantly on duty.&nbsp; The others were selected from the
stoutest youth in the families of the Zemindars, and were
relieved as often as they pleased, by their parents or kinsmen
sending other youths in their place; for no sort of instruction
in military evolution was attempted, and <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>the only
exercise was shooting at a mark.&nbsp; The privates of this class
received daily rations of food, and twice a year from 20 to 100
rupees, according to their supposed intrepidity.&nbsp; Those,
however, who received more than 25 rupees were few in
number.&nbsp; The whole troops were armed with matchlock, sword,
and target.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>I now proceed to give an account of the various states and
principalities which this mountainous region contained, and of
the manner in which they became subject to the chiefs of Gorkha;
and I shall commence at the Eastern extremity, proceeding
westward regularly, so far as I can, without interrupting the
account of each family.</p>

<span class="smcap">of the states east from the river

<h4>SECTION I.<br />
<span class="smcap">country of sikim</span>.</h4>
<p
class="gutsumm">Inhabitants.&mdash;Government.&mdash;Extent.&mdash;History.&mdash;Geography.</p>
<p>The most eastern principality, in the present dominions of
Gorkha, is that of the Lapchas, called Sikim.&nbsp; Although the
prince of Sikim was a Bhotiya, the strength of his army consisted
entirely of the Lapchas, who inhabited the higher mountains
between the Kankayi and Tista.&nbsp; The Bhotiyas themselves are
a very timid race, entirely sunk under the enervating effects of
what they call religion.</p>
<p>Besides the Bhotiyas, who surrounded the prince, and the
Lapchas by whom he was guarded, the mountains of Sikim contained
many people of the tribe called Limbu, who have been already
mentioned.&nbsp; My informant thinks, that of the whole
population three-tenths were Bhotiyas, five-tenths Lapchas, and
two tenths Limbus.</p>
<p>The princes of Sikim, as I have said, were Bhotiyas.&nbsp;
They were of a family of high rank from Lasa, and took the title
of Gelpo.&nbsp; The next person in the state was the chief or
Hang <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>of the Lapchas.&nbsp; I suspect that
the Gelpo possessed little power, except in matters of religion;
for it is said, that his neighbour, the Deva Dharma Raja,
although a mere priest, appoints whomsoever he pleases to manage
the temporal affairs of his country; but in Sikim the office of
Hang is hereditary.&nbsp; I have not learned the succession of
the princes of Sikim; but it is probable that the Bhotiyas have
governed the country for a considerable time.</p>
<p>At one time the princes of Sikim had extended their dominion
far south, into the district of Puraniya, and possessed the low
country on the east of the Mahananda, as far as Krishnagunj, a
part of the country which was originally possessed by the Koch
and Paliyas, the natives of Kamrup and Matsya, now the districts
of Ranggapur and Dinajpur.&nbsp; The Rajas of Sikim were driven
from the greatest part of this most valuable of their possessions
by the Moslems; but they still retained a small space of the
plain to the north of the Pergunah of Baikunthapur, when they
were attacked by the Gorkhalese.&nbsp; Although the Kankayi, in
the upper part of its course, was nearly their boundary, they
never would appear to have possessed the plain between the
Kankayi and Mahananda; but they were lords of the lower hills,
occupied by the tribe called Dimali, who, I am assured, are the
same with the Mech, a tribe now confined to the eastern parts of
Kamrup or Ranggapur.</p>
<p>The chief who governed Sikim before the year 1782, was by the
natives of the Company&rsquo;s territory named Rup Chiring; but
the Bhotiya names are so mangled by the Bengalese, that no
reliance can be placed on those reported by them.&nbsp; He
resided at Darjiling, and had there a fort, or strong house of
brick, which an old Bengalese, who visited it about that time,
describes as very splendid; but his ideas of magnificence in
building are <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>probably rather confined.&nbsp; This
prince died about the year 1782, and was succeeded by his son,
the Chhawa Raja, which is the name that the low country people
give to the heir-apparent of this family.&nbsp; During his time,
and, as would appear from a letter addressed by Mr Pagan to
Colonel Ross, in the month of September, (probably of 1788, for
there is no date in the letter,) the Gorkhalese invaded
Sikim.&nbsp; Their troops consisted of about 6000 men, of whom
2000 were regulars, and were under the command of Tiurar Singha,
Subah of Morang.&nbsp; He met with no opposition until he
approached Sikim, the capital, in defence of which the Rajah
ventured an engagement; when, after an obstinate resistance, he
was completely defeated, owing, in all probability, to the 2000
fusileers.&nbsp; The Gorkhalese, however, suffered much, although
they immediately laid siege to the capital.&nbsp; This happened
shortly previous to the 28th October 1788, as, in a letter from
Mr Pagan of that date, he mentions, that he had just received
accounts of the entire conquest of Sikim by the Gorkhalese, who,
in this report, had considerably magnified the extent of their
victory.</p>
<p>The Raja of Sikim retired towards the frontier of Thibet, in
order to reassemble his army, and to solicit assistance from Lasa
and Tasasudan.&nbsp; At the latter place was soon concluded a
treaty, by which the Sikim chief engaged to pay the Deva Dharma
Raja a certain tribute, on condition of his being restored to his
dominions by the exertions of that prince.&nbsp; This negotiation
is said to have been facilitated by an open boast made by the
Gorkhalese, that they no sooner should have conquered Sikim, than
they would attack the Deva Dharma Raja, a kind of policy of which
the Gorkhalese are fond, when they have no sort of intention of
putting their threats in execution.</p>
<p>The Raja, strengthened by a considerable force of the Deva
Dharma&rsquo;s troops, and a party of Bhotiyas from a province of
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Thibet, named Portaw, returned towards the capital,
and, about the beginning of December, compelled the Gorkhalese to
raise the siege; and, after losing many men in a skirmish, to
retire towards Ilam on the Kankayi, where they had erected forts
to secure a communication with Morang.&nbsp; It must be observed,
that, at this time, the Gorkhalese had invaded the province of
Kutti in Thibet, and had there met with a repulse; and that a
body of the troops of Thibet had penetrated through a pass in the
mountains to the eastward of Kutti.&nbsp; These troops seized on
the passes of the Kosi and Arun rivers, thus intending to cut off
all communication between Kathmandu and the army in Morang; an
excellent plan, and very easily practicable.</p>
<p>The Gorkhalese commander, far from being dismayed, seems soon
to have dispossessed these troops, and gave out that he had
retreated from Sikim merely on account of the severity of the
cold.</p>
<p>From the reports of the natives, there is reason to suppose,
that about this time the Sikim Raja died, leaving his son Kurin
Namki, an infant.&nbsp; The war was chiefly conducted by
Yuksu-thuck, the Hang or chief of the Lapchas, who was next in
rank to the Raja.&nbsp; This man, by the natives of the low
country, was called Chhatrajit, and was a person of barbarous
energy.&nbsp; He seems to have headed the army in the field,
while his brother Nam-si (Lamjit of the Bengalese) defended the
capital.&nbsp; They were sons of Lang-cho, son of De-sha, both of
whom had held the office of Hang.</p>
<p>Soon after these advantages over the Gorkhalese, the troops of
the Deva Dharma Raja retired; for they are allowed no pay, and
the country was too poor to admit of plunder.&nbsp; By a letter
from Mr Pagan, this would appear to have happened before the 29th
March 1789.&nbsp; On this the greater part of the <!-- page
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>people of Sikim submitted to the Gorkhalese; but the
Raja fled to Tankiya in Thibet, and the chief of the Lapchas
retired to a stronghold situated between the two branches of the
Tista; from which he has ever since annoyed the Gorkhalese.&nbsp;
This place, called Gandhauk, has annexed to it a territory of
considerable extent, and affords the Raja a revenue of about 7000
rupees a-year, which is all that he possesses; but, being a man
of high birth, he lately obtained in marriage a daughter of the
chief minister at Lasa, with whom, in 1809, he returned to the
petty dominion, which the vigour of his minister has
retained.</p>
<p>Both the Deva Dharma Raja and the government of Lasa seem to
have been most seriously alarmed at the progress of the
Gorkhalese, and applied to the Emperor of China for his
interposition.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, the Deva Dharma Raja is
said to have sent an embassy to Kathmandu, offering as a
sacrifice the part of Baikunthapur, that had been given to him by
Mr Hastings; but the interposition of the emperor came in time to
save this, and the Gorkhalese have ever since abstained from
giving him any molestation.&nbsp; The people of Thibet were not
so fortunate, and were compelled to cede to the Nepalese a part
of Kutti, which now forms the government of Kheran or Kheru, on
the head of the Sankosi, and some Bhotiya villages near the Arun,
which are now annexed to the northern part of Vijaypur, and with
that form the government of Chayenpur.&nbsp; By a letter from
Colonel Ross, dated in the end of December 1789, it would appear
that our government had received intelligence of every thing
having been settled by the interference of the Chinese, and that
a Gorkhalese envoy had been dispatched to pay homage to the
emperor.</p>
<p>The Lapchas were, however, not so easily managed.&nbsp; Part
<!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>under their chief Nam-si maintained an absolute
independence, and the remainder have been so troublesome, that
the Gorkhalese have judged it prudent to give them a governor,
or, at least, a collector of their own.&nbsp; This person, named
Yu-kang-ta, and called Angriya Gabur by the Bengalese, is nephew
of the Lapcha chief, who has so gallantly defended the remnant of
the principality.&nbsp; In 1808, I found that he was in
possession of the whole civil government, and had agreed to pay
annually a fixed sum as tribute.&nbsp; The Subah of Chayenpur
was, however, in military authority over him, and there were
Gorkhalese troops at Sikim and Darjiling, the two chief places in
the district.</p>
<p>On the return of the young Raja to Gandhauk, he brought with
him as an escort 500 Bhotiyas of Thibet; and an insurrection
seems to have been meditated.&nbsp; In the end of 1809, a person
calling himself Dihit Karan, a relation of the chief of the
Kirats, came to Lieutenant Munro, then stationed at Sannyasikata,
and informed him that he had been sent as an ambassador by the
Chinese general, (Vazir,) who had arrived with 15,000 men and 40
guns to restore the Prince of Sikim, and that he was on his way
to Puraniya, to proceed from thence to Calcutta.&nbsp; From the
information of his nearest relations, there is reason to think
that Dihit Karan had died before this time, and the messenger did
not go to Puraniya.&nbsp; It is probable that he merely came to
sound Mr Munro, whether or not there was any actual appearance of
hostility between the British government and the
Gorkhalese.&nbsp; The only troops that had come were the 500
armed Bhotiyas; but with even these the enterprising Lapcha is
said to have determined to proceed, and a good many Gorkhalese
soldiers marched in that direction.&nbsp; At this time the Lapcha
died, and after a little <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>skirmishing
things were amicably adjusted, the Sikim Raja retaining Gandhauk
alone.</p>
<p>The map of this country drawn by the Lama, and mentioned in
the Introduction, although very rude, as might be naturally
expected, will enable scientific men to throw considerable light
on the geography of that country, hitherto almost unknown, and
more reliance is to be placed on most of the Lama&rsquo;s
positions, than on those given in the map of the countries east
from Nepal, which has been mentioned in the same place, except
towards the south-west corner, for the Lama was better acquainted
with the other parts of the country than the person who
constructed the map to which I have alluded.&nbsp; His scale is
an inch to the day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; His angular lines
represent mountains, and, beginning at the north, we find Khawa
karpola, that is, the mountain white with snow, or the highest
ridge of Emodus, which separates Sikim from the dominion of
Lasa.&nbsp; According to the map, this ridge is penetrated by
three rivers.&nbsp; That on the west is the Kankayi; but it seems
doubtful whether or not this actually rises from beyond the
highest peaks of Emodus, for, in another map, which will be
afterwards mentioned, its source is made to come from a lower
range of the snowy mountains, which by some is called Mirgu; and
this opinion is strongly confirmed by its size, when it enters
the plains.&nbsp; The Kankayi would appear to run in a narrow
valley between two ridges of mountains, and for some way down the
whole valley belonged to Sikim.&nbsp; In this are two Golas or
marts, Bilasi and Majhoya.&nbsp; To these marts the low country
traders carry rice, salt, extract of sugar-cane, hogs, dry fish,
tobacco, spirituous liquor, and various cloths.&nbsp; Formerly
they took oxen for slaughter, but, since the conquest, this has
been prohibited.&nbsp; They procured in return <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>cotton,
Indian madder, (Manjit,) musk, and Thibet bull-tails,
(Chaungris.)</p>
<p>Farther down, the Kankayi formed the boundary between the
Kirats and Sikim, until it reached the plain, the whole of which,
as far as the Mahananda, belonged to the Vijaypur Rajas, while
all the low hills belonged to Sikim.&nbsp; These low hills are
not represented in the map, although they are of very
considerable size, such as the greater part of the mountains of
Scotland or Wales; but, near Emodus, these appear like
molehills.&nbsp; The hilly country, I am told by the traders,
commences at what they call six coses north from Sannyasikata,
and extends about eighteen coses farther to Siumali, another
mart, which the low country people name Dimali.</p>
<p>The hills south of Dimali are thinly inhabited by the Mech or
Dimali, who cultivate cotton, rice, and other articles, in the
same manner as the Garos, which will be described in my account
of Asam.&nbsp; This kind of country extends from the Kankayi to
the Tista, everywhere, probably, about the same width; but the
coses, in all likelihood, are very short, twelve of them being
reckoned a day&rsquo;s journey, and, in such roads, twelve miles
is a long journey, and will give no great horizontal
distance.</p>
<p>Between the Mahananda and Tista the Sikim Raja possessed a low
tract, four or five coses wide, which is inhabited by Koch, and
cultivated with the plough.&nbsp; The chief place in it is Dabi,
on the east bank of the Mahananda.&nbsp; This part is not noticed
in the Lama&rsquo;s map.</p>
<p>Siumali, or Dimali, according to the Bengalese, is a
custom-house on the east side of the Bala kongyar river, but the
Lama places it on the west, and is probably more correct, the
Bengalese concerning such points being uncommonly stupid.&nbsp;
At this custom-house or mart is a Lapcha collector, appointed
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>by Yu-kang-ta.&nbsp; He has with him four Bengalese
writers, to assist him in collecting the duties.&nbsp; The
custom-house consists of a square surrounded by buildings, in
which the traders and their commodities are received, for there
is no house near, except those of the collector and his
assistants.&nbsp; The traders from the low country take up salt,
tobacco, cotton cloth, goats, fowls, swine, iron, and
occasionally a little coral, and broad cloth.&nbsp; They bring
back Indian madder, (Manjit,) cotton, beeswax, blankets, horses,
musk, bull-tails, (Chaungris,) Chinese flowered silk, (Devang,)
and rhinoceroses horns.</p>
<p>North from the mart, half a day&rsquo;s journey, on a hill at
the source of the Bala kongyar, is the residence of Yu-kang-ta,
the Lapcha chief, who now collects the revenues for the
Gorkhalese.&nbsp; By the natives it is called Sam-dung, but the
Bengalese call it Nagrikoth.&nbsp; They describe it as a very
large building, with several stories, and it was represented to
Mr Monro as a fort of some strength.&nbsp; Both accounts are,
however, doubtful, as I learn that it is roofed only with
thatch.&nbsp; Two days&rsquo; journey east from this, at the
source of the Mahananda, is Satang, another Gola or mart; but, of
late, Siumali has engrossed almost the whole trade.</p>
<p>Immediately north from these places the Lama lays down a high
ridge of mountains, extending from the Kankayi beyond the Tista,
and on this he says that Dalimkoth, belonging to Bhotan, is
situated, and he makes it communicate with the snowy mountains,
both at the Kankayi and to the east of the Tista.&nbsp; All the
rivers between the Kankayi and Tista spring from the south side
of this chain, and between its two arms is included the greater
part of Sikim, watered by various branches of the Tista, and
forming, as it were, a valley; but the whole of this space is
extremely mountainous, though there <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>is much
cultivation carried on with the hoe.&nbsp; The great articles of
cultivation are rice and Manjit.</p>
<p>Beyond Sam-dung and Sa-tang one day&rsquo;s journey, and on
the other side of the first high mountains, is Darjiling, which
would appear to be the chief fortress of the country, as it is
there that the Gorkhalese troops are mostly stationed.&nbsp; From
thence to Sikim, the capita], is six days&rsquo; journey, and the
snowy mountains are about the same distance still farther
north.&nbsp; Sikim is on the west side of the Jhamikuma river,
which arises from the south side of the snowy mountains, and,
opposite to the town, divides into two branches, which surround
an immense mountain, on the top of which there is a small level
and strong-hold named Tasiding.&nbsp; The descent from this to
the river is reckoned half a day&rsquo;s journey on each
side.&nbsp; Some way below this, the river receives from the west
a branch named Rainam, that rises from the mountains, by which
the Kankayi is bounded on the east.&nbsp; The united streams are
called the Rimikma, which soon joins the Tista.</p>
<p>The great river Tista arises in the dominions of Lasa by two
branches, called the Greater and Lesser Tista, and passes through
the snowy mountains.&nbsp; The western branch forms the boundary
between the dominions of the Gorkhalese and the petty territory
of Gan-dhauk, which still remains to the Raja of Sikim.&nbsp;
This poor prince possesses also a small portion beyond the lesser
or eastern Tista, which, however, in general, forms the boundary
between him and Bhotan, or the country of the Deva Dharma
Raja.&nbsp; On its east side is Dam-sang, a fortress belonging to
the last-mentioned prince.&nbsp; The united stream of the two
Tistas forms the present boundary between him and Gorkha.</p>
<p>The only route between Sikim and Thibet is by a passage
through the snowy mountains, named Phakali, and this is seven
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>days&rsquo; journey from Jang-chim, in the north-east
part of the Sikim territory, so that, the route being through the
territory of the Deva Dharma Raja, the people of Sikim were
entirely dependent on this prince for a communication with
Thibet.</p>

<p>The next principality to that of the Lapchas was that of the
Kiratas, which fell to the lot of a family that pretends to be
sprung from the Rajas of Chitaur, although its claims, as I have
said, are by no means well substantiated, and the different
branches of the family differ much in the account of their
genealogy.</p>
<p>In the account of the Newars, I have mentioned, that the tribe
called Bhawar or Bhar has many territories, which had <!-- page
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>been subject to a powerful chief, whose capital was
Garsamaran in Tirahut, and the dominion of these Bhawars extended
once all over Gorakhpur.&nbsp; Garsamaran was destroyed in 1322
by the Muhammedans, and in its vicinity a state of anarchy, under
petty chiefs, prevailed for twenty-four years, while the
Muhammedans seized on the parts towards the Ganges.&nbsp; About
1306, the Muhammedans had destroyed Chitaur, and expelled from
thence the Chauhan tribe, called also Sisaudhiyas, because they
had been settled in a town of that name before they occupied
Chitaur.</p>
<p>In the account given of the mountain Hindus, I have mentioned,
that these Chauhans are said to have retired to the mountains,
and founded the dynasties of Karuvirpur and Yumila; but another
family pretends also to be descended from the Rajas of Chitaur,
and to have long occupied a great extent of country to the east,
south, and west of Nepal Proper.&nbsp; In the eastern parts of
this dominion, it was said, that the first chiefs of this family,
who came to the parts of which I am now treating, were Jil and
Ajil Rays, sons of Buddhi, brother of Chitra Sen, Raja of
Chitaur, and son of Pratap Sen, son of Udayraj Sen, of the
Sisaudhiya tribe of the Kshatriya race.&nbsp; These two
adventurers, with 700 soldiers of fortune, entered into the
service of Karma Singha, a person of the impure tribe of Bhawar,
which is very numerous in the low country subject to Nepal.&nbsp;
This chief resided at Rajpur, on the west side of the Gandaki or
Salagrami, where that great river enters the plains, and he had
subject to him many of his countrymen, who chiefly cultivated the
low lands, and some Kirats, and other barbarians, who occupied
the adjacent hills, and formed his military power.&nbsp; He is
said to have had two brothers, Nandakumar, Raja of Nandapur
Tisuti, near Bhawara, (Bawara R.) in Tirahut, and Sarandeo, Raja
of Belka on the Kosi.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>For twenty-two years the Hindu nobles served this low
man, but were then able to cut him off, and Ajil Sen assumed the
government.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his son Tula Sen; and it
must be observed, that all the princes of this family are called
Sen, which I shall for the future in general omit, although among
the natives, in speaking of them, it is always annexed.&nbsp;
Tula built on the hills the fortress of Makwanpur, (Mocaumpour,
R.) since which time the principality has been often called by
that name, but it seems then to have extended only from the large
Gandaki to the Adhwara River.&nbsp; He was succeeded in regular
lineal descent by Dambhal, Gajapati, Chandra, Rudra, and Mukunda,
by which time the principality had been extended far towards the
west, over the mountains of the Magars and Gurung.</p>
<p>In the western parts of the territory belonging to this
family, I procured a manuscript said to have been composed by
Rana Bahadur, late Chautariya of Palpa, and one of its
descendants.&nbsp; He states, that the first of his ancestors,
who came to this country, was Rudra Sen, the son of Chandra Sen,
Raja of Chitaur, descended of Ratna Sen, first Chauhan chief of
that city; but I think that this account is not tenable, and
Samar Bahadur, the brother of Rana Bahadur, gives one totally
different, and, in my opinion, more probable.&nbsp; He says, that
Ratna Sen, instead of being the first Raja of Chitaur, was the
last of these princes; and that Naya Sen, his eldest son, settled
at Prayag or Allahabad, which he seized with 20,000 men, and he
considers Tutha Sen, Ribeli Sen, Dimirawa Sen, Udayarawa Sen,
Udayachanda Sen, Jagadbrahma Sen, Dharma Pala Sen, Aneka Singha
Sen, Ramraja Sen, and Chandra Sen, the father of Rudra Sen, not
as Rajas of Chitaur, as his brother&rsquo;s manuscript
represents, but as chiefs of the colony from that city, which
settled in the vicinity of Nepal.&nbsp; Tutha <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Sen, he
says, having been driven from Prayag, seized on the country
adjacent to the hills of Butaul, and afterwards seized on the
principality of Champaranya, the capital of which was
Rajpur.&nbsp; Now, this seems highly probable, for Chitaur was
taken in about 1306, and Garsamaran, of which Champaranya was
originally a dependency, did not fall until 1322, while an
anarchy prevailed throughout the territories of Garsamaran until
1346, that is to say, until these were mostly reunited under the
colony from Chitaur, 40 years after the fall of that city.&nbsp;
It is, therefore, unlikely, that the chief who left Chitaur
should have seen his family established in a new dominion; but,
that it should have been his son who accomplished this event, as
Samar Bahadur says, is highly probable.&nbsp; Tutha&rsquo;s first
acquisition on the hills seems to have been Rishiyang, now an
inconsiderable place between Butaul and Palpa.&nbsp; His son
founded Ribdikot in that vicinity, of which it continued to be
the capital, until Palpa was founded by Rudra Sen.&nbsp; It must
be observed, that the accounts procured in Puraniya and Gorakhpur
differ totally as to names, until the time of Chandra Sen, after
which they agree tolerably well, and Rudra was probably the first
of the family, as his descendant alleges, who assumed the title
of the Palpa Raja.&nbsp; It is agreed by all, that the Makanda
Sen, the son of Rudra, possessed very extensive dominions, and
might probably have founded a kingdom equal to that which the
Gorkhalese now enjoy, but he had the imbecility to divide his
estates among his four sons.&nbsp; The accounts concerning these
sons differ somewhat.&nbsp; According to what I heard in
Puraniya, Manik, the eldest son, obtained Palpa, Bhringgu
received Tanahung, Rajpur the original possession of the family,
was given to Arjun, and Makwanpur, with its hardy mountaineers,
fell to the lot of Lohangga.&nbsp; But the account given in the
manuscript of Rana Bahadur, which <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>here, I
think, deserves most credit, is, that the eldest son was Binayak,
who communicated his name to a large territory on the plain west
from the Gandaki, which he received as his patrimony; but this
territory is now most commonly called Butaul, from its chief
town, and in the low country the chiefs are commonly called the
Butaul Rajas.&nbsp; The second son, Manik, obtained Palpa; the
third son, Bihangga, (Bhringga of the Puraniya account,) obtained
Tanahung, and Lohangga, the fourth son, obtained Makwanpur.</p>
<p>I shall now return to the Kiratas, the nation next to the
Lapchas, when they were about to receive Lohangga as their
chief.</p>
<p>At that time the country between the Kosi and the Kankayi, and
on the plain so far as the Mahanandah, was subject to
Vijayanarayan, whose ancestors are said to have come from
Kamrup.&nbsp; From his title, one might be led to suppose that he
was of the Vihar family; but one of this race, who was in my
service, denied any such relation; and, indeed, as Vijaya is said
to have been the seventh prince of his family, he could scarcely
have been descended of the grandson of the Koch Hajo, ancestor of
the chief&rsquo;s of Vihar.&nbsp; The natives allege, that the
title of the chiefs of this family was Harbhang Raja, and that
the title of his minister was Bharbhang Mantri.&nbsp; Harbhang
Bharbhang, in the provincial dialect, implies foolish, similar to
the notions entertained by the Bengalese of Havachandra and
Bhavachandra of Kamrup, which may perhaps serve to connect the
history of the two dynasties.&nbsp; Not that these princes seem
to have been more foolish than their neighbours, but they
probably had some customs, that appeared extraordinary to their
subjects.&nbsp; Two dynasties are mentioned as having preceded
that of the Harbhang Rajas; 1<i>st</i>, That of Kichak Raja,
contemporary with Yudhishthir; and, 2<i>d</i>, That of <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>the Satya Rajas, in whose time probably the power of
the Kirats or Kichaks was at the greatest height.</p>
<p>I have received three accounts of the manner in which
Vijayanarayan was overthrown.&nbsp; The first was given me orally
by Agam Singha.&nbsp; He says, that the ancestors of
Vijayanarayan originally possessed only the low country called
Morang; but that this prince took into his service his ancestor
Singha Ray, the son of Khebang, who was Hang or hereditary chief
of the Kirats, that occupied the hills north from Morang.&nbsp;
When the needy mountaineers had for some time been accustomed to
the luxuries of the plains, the Raja built Vijayapur, and took
the title of Vijaya Bharati, or victorious over the earth.&nbsp;
He soon after took occasion to put the mountain chief to death,
under pretence, that he, being an impure beef-eating monster, had
presumed to defile a Hindu woman.&nbsp; Baju Ray, son of the
mountain chief, immediately retired, and, going to the Rajput
chief of Makwanpur, promised to join him with all his Kirats, if
that prince would enable him to destroy the murderer of his
father.&nbsp; This was accordingly done, and the Hang was
constituted sole Chautariya or hereditary chief minister of the
principality, which dignity his descendants enjoyed, until its
total overthrow, and Agam Singha, the last possessor of the
office, accompanied his master, when he fled for refuge into the
Company&rsquo;s territory, and now lives with the mother of that
unfortunate youth.</p>
<p>The second account was given by the Munsuf of Bahadurgunj,
mentioned in the Introduction.&nbsp; He nearly agrees with the
Kirat chief, but says, that the new dynasty was formed in a
manner entirely peaceable.&nbsp; Vijayanarayan having died
without heirs, the Kirat chief, who was the second person in the
government, invited a brother of the Palpa Raja to take
possession of the government.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>The third account was communicated to me in writing by
Premnarayan Das, mentioned also in the Introduction.&nbsp; The
scribe says, that one day Vijayanarayan went to Varahachhatra, a
place of pilgrimage on the Kosi, where Vishnu is worshipped under
the form of a boar.&nbsp; Here he found a Sannyasi, Ramanath
Bharati, who, warned by a dream, had come from Surya kunda, and
had taken up his residence in a hut near the place of worship,
where he was assiduous in prayer.&nbsp; The Sannyasi having been
insolent to the Raja, a circumstance not at all improbable, the
prince had the audacity to kick him down the hill, and to burn
his hut.&nbsp; The god then appeared to the saint in a human
form, and gave him authority of speech, (Bakya Siddhi,) by which
all men would obey his command.&nbsp; Bharati then went to the
poor chief of Makwanpur, who, having been kind and attentive, was
commanded to take possession of the dominions of Vijayanarayan,
and was informed how it might be done.</p>
<p>The account of the Kirat is evidently the most credible,
although it is not unlikely that Ramanath may have been
disgusted, and might have been employed to gain over the people,
and to negotiate between the Rajput and Kirat; but the scribe
alleges, that these barbarians were not elevated to the first
office of the state until a later period.&nbsp; However that may
be, in the remainder of the history, I shall follow chiefly his
account, although even there it differs in some particulars from
the accounts that I received both from Agam Singha, and from the
Brahman.</p>
<p>Lohangga, on crossing the Adhwara, first subdued a petty chief
of the Magar tribe.&nbsp; He then took possession of a small
territory on the plain, belonging to an Aniwar Brahman.&nbsp;
Then he destroyed Mohan Thakur, another chief of the last
mentioned tribe, and seized on his territory, which now forms
<!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>the district of Mahatari.&nbsp; He in a similar manner
seized on Korani, belonging to a Bhawar, and probably a
descendant of Nandakumar, (p. 129;) on Khesraha, belonging to
Raja Langkeswar; on Rampur belonging to Raja Muzles; on Pokhari,
belonging to Raja Karabandar; on Jhamuna, belonging to Raja Roja;
on Jogoda, belonging to Raja Udaygir; on Dhapar, Kalisa, and
Belka koth, belonging to Raja Karnadeo; on Samda, belonging to
Ballabh deo; and on Karjain, belonging to Dullabh deo, a brother
of the two last mentioned chiefs, who were descended of Saran
deo, brother of Karma Singha and Nandakumar, (p. 129,) as I am
informed by Gauri Chaudhuri, their representative, and now
Zemindar of Dhapar, in the district of Puraniya.&nbsp; All these
were petty independent chiefs, whose territories now form
Pergunahs in the Subah of Saptari, belonging to Gorkha, or in the
adjacent parts of the Company&rsquo;s territory.&nbsp; The
rapacious chief now made an attack on the hill Gidha, but here he
was opposed by a devil, (Dano,) who killed a number of his
troops, and prevailed, until the holy man Ramanath ordered the
god Ramkrishna to cut off the devil&rsquo;s head, which was
accordingly done.&nbsp; The Raja then descended to Meghvari on
the banks of the Kosi, where he learned that Vijayanarayan had
died.&nbsp; He, therefore, left one-half of his troops at
Meghvari, and, advancing with the other, took quiet possession of
Vijayapur, (Bissypur, R.)&nbsp; The nature of these transactions
strongly confirms the account given by Agam Singha, as the force
of the petty district of Makwanpur seems to have been totally
inadequate to effect such conquests; but the junction of the
Kirats will readily account for the success.</p>
<p>Agam Singha says, that during these wars, his ancestor Baju
was killed, and was succeeded by his son Bidyachandra, who
relinquished the title of Hang, and in its stead took that of
Chautariya, and who, like all his successors, assumed a Hindu
<!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>name, and adopted some degree of purity in his manner
of life.</p>
<p>Lohangga had now acquired a very extensive territory, reaching
from the Adiya on the west to the Mahananda on the east, and from
the alps of Bhot to Julagar near Puraniya.&nbsp; When the
Sannyasi had placed the Raja on the throne, he wished to return
to his native country, but, at the intercession of the prince, he
remained some time longer, having been appointed priest (Mahanta)
to a temple (Math) erected at Varaha Chhatra, and well
endowed.&nbsp; According, indeed, to my authority, the priests,
his successors, seem to have held a distinguished place in the
state; but, since the conquest, they have sunk into
insignificance, although the Gorkhalese still allow them ample
endowments.</p>
<p>Lohangga had two sons, Raghav&rsquo; and Bhagawanta, but
rationally left the whole of his dominions to the former, who, by
all other persons except the scribe, is considered as having been
the founder of the family in these parts, and as a brother of the
Raja of Palpa.&nbsp; In his reign Ramanath delivered over his
office to Jagamoban, and disappeared; but he promised his
successor to favour him with an annual visit.</p>
<p>Harihar&rsquo;, the son of Raghav&rsquo;, extended his
dominions to Gondwara, and took the title of Hindupati, or chief
of the Hindus.&nbsp; His wife, Jagamata, having been delivered of
a daughter of most extraordinary beauty, he, in his joy, called
to her by her name; but, as it is totally contrary to Hindu law
for a man to call his wife Mata, that is, mother, he was under
the necessity of divorcing her, which will, perhaps, show that
his civilians had a considerable skill in discovering legal
pretexts for the actions of their prince.&nbsp; The chief was
soon after supplied with other wives, for, having made war on the
Vihar Raja, and taken that prince in battle, his anger was
pacified <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>by obtaining Mahisi and Maheswari,
two beautiful daughters of the descendant of Siva.&nbsp; By
Mahisi the Morang Raja had four sons, Chhatrapati, Padma, Pratap,
and one who died an infant.&nbsp; Maheswari bore only one son,
named Subha, to whom his father intended to leave the whole of
his dominions, and, in order to secure his authority, gave him
immediate possession of the territory of Makwani.</p>
<p>After this, Harihar seems to have fallen into a state of
dotage, and his three sons by Mahisi rose upon their aged parent,
and put him in confinement.&nbsp; In this difficulty he applied
to Adanuka, the wife of Chhatrapati, one of these unnatural sons,
and promised, if she would procure his release, that he would
leave the whole of his kingdom to the child with which she was
then pregnant.&nbsp; This lady, who seems to have possessed great
abilities, persuaded her husband and his two brothers to release
their father, on condition that the whole kingdom should be
divided into four equal shares, one for each brother.&nbsp; The
three sons of Mahisi then went and attacked their brother, in
order to compel him to agree to this engagement, but they were
defeated with great loss, and retreated to Phulwari, on the
Kamala river, where Adanuka was delivered of a son, whom his
grandfather immediately created king of all the territories east
from the Kosi, while he left all on the west of that river to his
son Subha.&nbsp; The father and uncles of the infant had probably
been too much weakened by their defeat to venture on any farther
enterprise of villainy.</p>
<p>I shall now follow the history of Subha, who soon after these
events fell sick, and sent for Ganggadhar, the successor of
Jagamohan as priest at Varaha Chhatra.&nbsp; This person informed
the Raja that he was just about to die, but, as he himself had
forty years of life to spare, he would transfer them to the
prince, for whom he had a great regard.&nbsp; The Raja accepted
<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>the offer, and soon after the priest went and buried
himself alive, (Samadi,) a manner of taking leave of the world
which is considered as very laudable, and to this day is
occasionally practised at Varaha Chhatra.&nbsp; The Raja, on the
strength of this accession of life, married a young Rajput named
Amarawati, by whom he had two sons, Mahapati and Manik.</p>
<p>Subha Sen had governed thirty-one years of his additional
life, when he had a dispute with Pradyumna Upadhyaya, a Brahman
of Tanahung, who was his Dewan, or minister of finance.&nbsp;
This traitor entered into a conspiracy with a certain officer
named Parasuram Thapa, and, in order to induce this man to rebel,
did not hesitate to give him his daughter in marriage, although
the fellow was of the spurious breed called Khas, descended by
the father&rsquo;s side alone from the sacred order; and this
would appear to be considered as by far the most reprehensible
part of the Brahman&rsquo;s offence.&nbsp; Having seized on the
old Raja, their master, these traitors intended to deliver him up
to Isfundiyar khan, the Nawab of Puraniya.&nbsp; By this time
Indu Bidhata, the infant who had been made Raja of Marang, had
grown up, and, hearing of his uncle&rsquo;s misfortune, led an
army against the Nawab and the traitors, and was accompanied by
his brother Budha Sen.&nbsp; Having obtained a victory, he
restored his uncle; but, while they were still in the midst of
their joy, Kalu Upadhyaya, a relation of the treacherous Brahman,
contrived to seize on both the uncle and nephews, and again
delivered them to the Nawab, who had made the most liberal
promises.&nbsp; It was on this occasion that the Moslems reduced
the greater part of the low country of Morang, and, in fact, they
settled some free land on the family of the traitor, but to no
great extent, and vastly less than was expected.&nbsp; One of his
descendants is now the Munsuf at <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Bahadurgunj, mentioned above as one of the persons from
whom I received information respecting this principality.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Subha and his nephews were sent to Dilli,
where Muhammed Azim, then emperor, deprived them of cast by a
curtailment of which the faithful are proud.</p>
<p>Prabodh das, the then Neb, or second hereditary minister of
the family, fled with the two sons of Subha Sen to the Kirats,
and his descendant, who gave me the written account, alleges that
it was then only that the chiefs of this tribe were elevated to
the dignity of Chautariya; but in this, I imagine, he is
mistaken.</p>
<p>Mahapati, the eldest son, was placed by the Kirat Bidyachandra
Ray on the throne of all that remained to the family east from
the Kamala river, while the smaller portion west from that river
was given to his brother Manik, to whom Prabodh das adhered; but
a Kirat of the same family with Bidyachandra acted as the
Chautariya of Manik, and Mahapati had a Neb of the family of
Prabodh das.</p>
<p>Mahapati married, but neglected his wife, and had eighteen
illegitimate children.&nbsp; Mahapati means elder son, and I was
assured by the Munsuf of Bahadurgunj, that his real name was
Mandhata.&nbsp; Here, indeed, I must follow chiefly the authority
of the Munsuf; for the descendant of Prabodh das is little
acquainted with the history of the eastern division, while the
Munsuf was naturally unwilling to speak of the western.</p>
<p>Mandhata governed eighteen or twenty years, and left his
territory to his natural son Kamdatt.&nbsp; I am informed by a
Brahman, who had resided long in these parts, and by an
intelligent Kirat, that Kamdatt lived on very bad terms with
Bichitra Ray, the Kirat Chautariya of this part of the
principality, who drove Kamdatt to Lasa, and placed on the throne
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Jagat, a younger but legitimate son of the western
branch of the family.&nbsp; This prince reconciled the Chautariya
to Kamdatt, and while Jagat reserved to himself the country
between the Kamala and Kosi, he gave all the territory east from
the latter river to his kinsman Kamdatt.&nbsp; Thus the
principality became divided into three shares.</p>
<p>Soon after this Bichitra the Chautariya died, and was
succeeded by Budhkarna his son, with whom Kamdatt continued to
live on the worst terms; sometimes the one, and then the other,
being under the necessity of flying from Vijayapur, which was the
seat of government.&nbsp; On one of these occasions Kamdatt came
to the Company&rsquo;s territory, and applied to Ghanasyam
Upadhyaya, of the family of the traitor who had betrayed Subha
Sen.&nbsp; The Brahman took him to Calcutta; but, receiving no
countenance from the Governor-General, they returned to the
frontier, where they raised some men, with whom Kamdatt recovered
the government of Morang.&nbsp; Kamdatt still farther enraged the
Kirat by putting his brother to death, on which event Budhkarna
applied to the legitimate heir of the family, then in exile, who
recommended an alliance with the Sikim Bhotiyas.&nbsp; Budhkarna
having gone to that country, and having formed an alliance with
its rulers, ten men were sent by them under pretence of adjusting
the differences between the prince and his minister.&nbsp; These
ruffians, having been admitted to a conference without suspicion,
rushed on Kamdatt and put him to death.&nbsp; Budhkarna then
placed on the throne of Vijayapur the legitimate heir, Karna Sen,
whom the Gorkhalese had then expelled from the middle
principality.&nbsp; He died in about eighteen months afterwards,
in the year 1774, leaving an only son, a boy, under the charge of
his widow, and of his Chautariya Agam Singha, descended in the
fifth degree from Bidya Chandra, who was contemporary, <!-- page
141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>according to Agam Singha, with the first Rajput prince
of this country.&nbsp; In the same year the Gorkhalese attacked
Vijayapur, and the widow fled with her son, and accompanied by
Agam Singha, to the Company&rsquo;s territory.</p>
<p>The widow, her son, and minister, settled near Nathpur; while
Budhkarna, after some fruitless engagements, went to Calcutta to
solicit assistance, but without success.&nbsp; He soon after came
towards the frontier, at Chilmari in the Company&rsquo;s
territory, from whence he was carried off by a party of
Gorkhalese soldiers disguised like robbers.&nbsp; He was taken to
Vijayapur, where, under pretence of avenging the death of
Kamdatt, the slender claim which the Gorkhalis used to cover
their unjust attack on the infant son of Karna Sen, he was put to
the most cruel tortures, which continued three days before he
expired.</p>
<p>The jealousy of Prithwi Narayan of Gorkha did not permit him
to view the poor child, then five years old, without anxious
fears.&nbsp; His first plan was to endeavour to inveigle him into
his power, by promising, on condition of an annual tribute, to
restore his inheritance.&nbsp; He next offered to hold the
territories of the youth from the British government, and to pay
an annual sum; for he was cruelly alarmed lest the governor
should interfere.&nbsp; At length he is alleged to have calmed
his fears by a stratagem worthy of his savage nature.&nbsp; A
Brahman was hired to insinuate himself into the favour of the
mother, to whom he represented himself as a person skilled in the
inoculation for the small pox.&nbsp; Having gained the
mother&rsquo;s consent, he performed the operation; but the
smallpox did not appear; in its stead most dreadful ulcerations
took place, and the child perished of a wretched disease.&nbsp;
It is in general believed that poison was used instead of matter,
and that the perpetrator was hired by Prithwi Narayan; <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>for, immediately after the operation, the Brahman
disappeared, and is supposed to have retired to Nepal.&nbsp; The
character of the prince does not leave much room to think that he
would hesitate about employing such means.</p>
<p>The unfortunate widow, deprived of her only hope, seems to
have harboured views of revenge.&nbsp; She sent to Mukunda Sen,
the Raja of Palpa, and, as I have said above, of the same family
with her husband, in order to request one of his sons, whom she
might adopt, and to whom she might transfer the right to the
middle and eastern divisions of the principality.&nbsp; The Raja
accordingly sent Dhwajavir, one of his younger sons, who came to
Puraniya in the year 1779, and sent letters to the Deva Dharma
Raja, to Sikim, to the Chaubisiya Rajas, and to the Governor of
Bengal, soliciting aid, but without the least probability of
success.&nbsp; He had remained about three years at Puraniya, and
had formed a friendship with Madrapati Ojha, a Brahman, who
managed the estate Dhumgar, within nine coses of the frontier of
Morang.&nbsp; He had also formed a friendship with a Ganes
Bharati Mahanta, a priest, who lived between Puraniya and
Dhumgar.&nbsp; This man, in the year 1782, promised, that, if the
youth came to his house, he would adopt him as his pupil,
(Chela), and lend him money, of which the young man was in much
need.&nbsp; On his arrival at the residence of this priest,
various delays and frivolous excuses were made to avoid the
performance of the promises; and the youth was tempted, by an
invitation from his friend Madrapati, to advance to Dhumgar,
where he and his attendants were entertained eight days, in the
office where the rents of the estate were collected.&nbsp; In the
night of the eighth day the party were suddenly awakened by the
approach of a body of men; and, on looking out, perceived that
these were armed, and had surrounded the house.&nbsp; The party
in the office <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>now looked for their arms; but these
had been removed in the night without their knowledge.&nbsp; They
soon learned, from the language of the people by whom the house
was surrounded, that they were Gorkhalese soldiers, who ordered
them, in opprobrious language, (Nekal Bahenchod,) to come
out.&nbsp; Several who went out were killed, but the Raja
remaining within, and all his people invoking the protection of
the Governor and of the Company, as usual in such cases, the
soldiers entered, and said, there is no Governor nor Company can
now give you any assistance.&nbsp; The Raja soon received a cut
in his forehead, and then acknowledged himself; asking them,
whether they intended to carry him away or to murder him.&nbsp;
They replied, that they came for his life; on which he began to
pray, and held out his head, which was cut off with a
sword.&nbsp; During the confusion a Brahman escaped, and repaired
to Madrapati, who replied with the utmost composure that he could
give no assistance.&nbsp; The Raja had with him thirty-four
people, of whom fifteen were killed, eleven wounded, and four
carried away.&nbsp; Among the killed were Ripumardan, a natural
son of Karna Sen Raja of Morang, and a messenger from the Sikim
Raja, with five of his attendants.&nbsp; The soldiers were
disguised like robbers, and took away such property as they found
with the Raja, more probably to show what they had effected than
for the sake of the plunder, as they gave no disturbance to the
people of the village.&nbsp; From all the circumstances attending
the event, few doubt that the scheme was preconcerted, and that
the Mahanta and Brahman were the agents of the Gorkhalese, to
decoy the youth within their reach.</p>
<p>The poor widow was now totally helpless.&nbsp; She was
originally allowed a pension of 100 rupees a month; but for many
years this has been withheld, and the Zemindars in the
Company&rsquo;s <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>territory are giving her great
trouble respecting some lands, which had been granted her free of
rent.&nbsp; Her sister-in-law died in the year 1810, in Tirahut,
where she had some villages, which she left by will to the
unfortunate old lady; but I am told that the Raja of Darbhangga
has seized on them as Zemindar, although his claim is probably
dubious, the grants having been made before the decennial
settlement.</p>
<p>Having thus traced the fate of Mandhata and his descendants, I
return to his brother Manik, who procured the share of the
principality that is west from the Kamala river.</p>
<p>By the Munsuf of Bahadurgunj, Manik is said to have governed
his country quietly for twenty years.&nbsp; Although his share of
the principality was one of the most productive of revenue, as
including a large portion of the plain, he had little power, few
of the hardy Kirats being under his authority; but then he was
exempted from the dangers arising from the turbulence of these
mountaineers.&nbsp; He left four sons, Hemcarna, Jagat,
Jaymanggal, and Vikram.&nbsp; The first succeeded his father, and
Jagat, as I have mentioned, was placed by the Kirats in the
government of that part of the principality which is situated
between the Kamala and Kosi.</p>
<p>Hemcarna had a son, Digbandan, and a daughter, Maiya Saheb, of
most extraordinary beauty.&nbsp; About this time first rose to
notice Prithwi Narayan Saha, whose ancestors had held the petty
territory of Gorkha, in some measure dependent on the Palpa
Rajas, the kinsman of Hemcarna.&nbsp; This person had by various
means acquired some little power, and had induced the people of
Lalita Patan to choose his brother Dalmar-dan Saha for their
king; for they had fallen into anarchy, and had displaced their
lawful sovereign of the Mal family, which had long been in
possession of the three principalities into which Nepal.&nbsp;
Proper had been divided.&nbsp; Prithwi Narayan, about this <!--
page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>time, offered himself as a suitor for the beautiful
daughter of Hemcarna, but was rejected with scorn, as a match far
beneath her rank.&nbsp; Soon after, however, he was the fortunate
suitor, but I do not exactly know the period.&nbsp; Hemcarna
having died, was succeeded by his son Digbandan, a very weak
prince, in whose affairs his brother-in-law, Prithwi Narayan,
soon began to interfere; and by his courage, liberality, and
strength of understanding, totally drew to himself the minds of
the soldiery.&nbsp; In the year 1761 he openly attacked his
brother-in-law, and took him and his family prisoners.&nbsp; The
chief persons that had resisted his attack he put to death, some
by the sword, some by the rope, and some by flaying them
alive.&nbsp; Their children he delivered to the most vile and
abominable tribe, (Sarki,) to be educated in their odious
profession, as outcasts.&nbsp; The captives he conducted to
Nepal, the open attack on which he then commenced; for, until
then, he had contented himself with seizing on the passes, by
which the valley is surrounded, and with fomenting dissensions
among the three divisions of the principality.&nbsp; In 1769,
having completed his conquest of Nepal Proper, he attacked the
petty Rajas west from Gorkha, usually called the Chaubisiya, or
Twenty-four.&nbsp; For some time he had rapid success, but in an
engagement with the Tanahung Raja, he was so roughly handled,
that he was compelled to relinquish these conquests.&nbsp; In the
meanwhile, his brother-in-law Digbandan, his wife, and seven
sons, were kept in close confinement, and were only prevented
from starving, by a pittance sent to them by their kinsman the
Palpa Raja.&nbsp; What became of the remainder of these
unfortunate persons I cannot say; but in the year 1780 Bhubar,
one of the sons of Digbandan, effected his escape to Betiya, in
the Company&rsquo;s territory, where he was kindly received, and
two villages, free from the obligation of paying any revenue,
were granted to him.&nbsp; He died lately, and has left two sons,
one of whom in 1810 was <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>eight, and
the other five years of age; and these are the undoubted legal
heirs to the whole principality founded by Lobangga Sen.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned, that Budkarna, the Kirat chief of
the eastern division of the principality, discontented with the
illegitimacy and temper of Kamdatt, invited Jagat, a younger son
of Manik, to assume the government, which he accordingly did, but
he seems to have been a person of moderation; he contented
himself with the middle portion of the principality, situated
between the Kamala and Kosi, and allowed Kamdatt to retain
whatever was beyond the latter river, for a maintenance, but not
as a sovereign.&nbsp; Jagat usually resided at Chaundandi and
Shikarmari, and died in peace.&nbsp; He had no son, and his
dominions went to his brother Vikram, who left them to his son
Karna Sen.&nbsp; In 1773 Prithwi Narayan, having somewhat
recovered from the defeat which the Tanahung Raja had given him,
attacked Karna Sen, and took his dominions.&nbsp; The fugitive
prince, as I have mentioned, was received by Budkharna, the
Kirat, as sovereign of Morang; but I have already given an
account of the miserable events that immediately after
happened.</p>
<p>Having now detailed the first origin and total overthrow of
the principality founded by the Rajput Lohangga, I shall mention
what I have learned concerning the nature of the government,
which his descendants administered.</p>
<p>The Raja, in most cases, seems to have given himself very
little trouble about the affairs of government, but was
surrounded by Rajputs and Khas much attached to his person and
family, and by Brahmans; by whom both he and his guards were
duped, and who seem to have been the most active intriguers of
the court.</p>
<p>Next in rank to the Raja was the Chautariya, who, as I have
said, appears to me to have always been a Kirat of the <!-- page
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>family, that had governed his nation before the union
with the Rajputs.&nbsp; The Kayastha alleges, indeed, that this
was not the case; but he appears to me to be either mistaken, or
to have made his representation from hatred to the Kirats, by
whose power the Rajas and their Hindu adherents were very much
controlled; for, setting aside the evidence of Agam Singha, a
plain unaffected man, but who may however be supposed to be
influenced by vanity, the Kayastha pretends, that, until a late
period, the office of Chautariya was held by the family of the
perfidious Brahman, who delivered Subha Sen to the Moslems; but
the descendant of that person does not pretend that his ancestors
ever enjoyed the dignity of Chautariya, and says, that they held
the lucrative appointment of Dewan, which will be afterwards
mentioned.&nbsp; The Chautariya signed all commissions and
orders, while the Raja applied his seal.&nbsp; The Raja might
punish the Chautariya in whatever manner he pleased, and even put
him to death; but he could not deprive him of his rank, nor his
son of the regular succession.&nbsp; This power of punishment,
however, must have been very much limited, as the Kirats seem to
have been entirely guided by their chief; and they composed
almost the whole strength of the state.&nbsp; The Chautariya was
allowed one-tenth part of the whole revenue.</p>
<p>The ancestor of the Kayastha held, by hereditary descent, the
office of deputy (Neb) Chautariya, and seems merely to have been
the person appointed by the Hindu Raja to carry on the writings
necessary to be executed by the chiefs of the Kirats, who, if we
may judge from Agam Singha, were no great penmen.</p>
<p>Next to the Chautariya was the Kazi or Karyi, to whose office
the Raja might appoint any person that he pleased.&nbsp; The
Karyi was usually the most active person in managing the affairs
of government, and received one-sixteenth of the profits of the
whole country.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Next to these was the Dewan, whose office, as I have
stated, was hereditary in a family of Brahmans.&nbsp; The Dewans
managed the whole collections of the territory on the plain, and
probably made much more than either Chautariya or Karyi, which,
joined to their birth, gave them great influence.&nbsp; When the
principality subdivided, each Raja had his Chautariya, Karyi, and
Dewan, who formed his council.</p>
<p>The regular military force consisted of two kinds.&nbsp;
First, the Rajputs and Khas, who generally resided near the
person of the Raja, and formed his immediate security.&nbsp; They
were by no means numerous, and were usually paid in money.&nbsp;
The other branch of the regular army was more numerous, and
consisted chiefly of Kirats.&nbsp; They were under the orders of
Serdars, but the number of men under each of these was not
defined; each was appointed to command a number proportioned to
the supposed extent of his abilities.&nbsp; The Serdars could at
pleasure be removed, or the number of their troops altered.&nbsp;
Each Serdar, in proportion to the extent of his command, received
a quantity of land in the hills, which he subdivided among his
officers and soldiers, reserving a share for himself.&nbsp; He
might at pleasure appoint new soldiers, or remove old ones; but
he received no regular tribute from the lands, although all his
men made him presents.&nbsp; When called upon by the Raja, he was
bound to appear in the field with his stipulated number of men;
and a few Kirats, in their turn, were always on duty at the
residence of the prince.&nbsp; When on actual service, the men
were allowed subsistence.&nbsp; The Kirats seem to have been
chiefly armed with swords and bows, their arrows being
poisoned.&nbsp; The Rajputs had fire-arms.&nbsp; It is said, that
there were in all 90,000 Kirats able to carry arms; but not above
5000 or 6000 were considered as regulars.&nbsp; The others paid
rent.</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>In the hills the management of the police and the
collection of the revenue was entrusted to officers called
Subahs, who accounted to the Dewans for the revenue, but as
commanding the militia, were subject to the Serdars.&nbsp; There
were also Zemindars, who appear to have held the property of the
soil, but were allowed to retain only a small portion (15 to 20
bigas) of good land, fit for transplanted rice, and for this they
were held bound to pay three rupees a-year, and to appear in the
field as a militia, when called upon by the Subah.&nbsp; The
Zemindar, however, as lord of the soil was entitled to cultivate,
without additional burden, as much as he pleased of any ground
not fit for transplanted rice, and no one could cultivate such
without giving him a present.&nbsp; Every family, except the
Zemindars, who cultivated this kind of ground, paid three rupees
a-year to the Raja, and the men, when required, were bound to
appear in the field.&nbsp; All the land fit for transplanted
rice, except that held by the Zemindars, was Melk or free of
revenue.&nbsp; Part had been granted to Brahmans and temples, and
part to various officers of the state, none of whom were paid in
money; but by far the greater part was given to the Serdars, for
the support of their men.&nbsp; Over every three or four villages
the Subah appointed a deputy, called a Duyariya.</p>
<p>In the hilly part of the country, much of the cultivation was
carried on by Adhiyars, who gave to the soldier, officer, or
Zemindar that employed them, one half of the produce for
rent.&nbsp; Each family of this kind paid a rupee a year to the
Raja.&nbsp; All persons not employed in agriculture (Sukhvas and
Khosvas) paid eight anas for ground-rent, and two anas for
holidays.&nbsp; No casts were exempted.</p>
<p>In the level country the lands were cultivated by tribes, who
had little or no turn for military affairs, and paid a <!-- page
150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>rent in money, which was collected under the Dewans by
Fouzdars, who managed districts (Garhis) by means of Chaudhuris,
who held manors, (Pergunahs,) and under these by Mokuddums, who
held villages, (Gangs.)&nbsp; In some places the word Pergunah
had not been adopted, but the Chaudhuri held the space between
two rivers, which is called a Khari.</p>
<p>Independent of the Dewans was a register called Suduriya, and,
wherever there was a deputy of the Dewan, the register had also a
deputy.&nbsp; In fact, the Mogul system of finance had been
completely introduced, while in the mountains the Hindu system of
military tenure seems to have been more completely retained.</p>
<p>The trial of civil causes was conducted at the capital by four
Bicharis, who appointed a deputy for the jurisdiction under each
Subah, and for each subdivision; and these judges seem to have
had a much greater authority than is usual in Hindu or Muhammedan
governments.&nbsp; Under the Bicharis and their deputies were
petty officers, named Duyariyas, who arrested offenders, and
decided petty suits.&nbsp; These were assisted by Kotwals, or
messengers.&nbsp; The reason of the attention paid to suits seems
to have been, that the Raja took one-fourth of all property
recovered by legal process, and allowed the judge a share; of
course, the complainant usually gained the cause.&nbsp; The
principal chance which the defendant had was giving a bribe
higher than the share that the judge would legally receive; but
the Raja was a check on this kind of gain.</p>
<p>In the hilly country there were no duties levied, except at
custom-houses placed on the passes towards the plain, or towards
the dominions of Lasa.&nbsp; On the plain there was a vast
variety of duties, similar to those now exacted, and which will
be afterwards detailed.</p>
<p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>I shall now proceed to consider the present state of
this principality, in the footing on which it has been placed by
the Gorkhalese.</p>
<p>In the first place, it has been divided into districts.</p>
<p>The eastern division of the principality, founded by Lohangga,
together with the part of Sikim, and a portion of Thibet, that
have been conquered, are now divided into two districts, (Zilas,)
Morang and Chayenpur, each under the management of a Subah.</p>
<p>Morang, in a general sense, extends in the low country from
the Tista to the Kosi, for the level country, that formerly
belonged to Sikim, has now been annexed to this district.&nbsp;
Its extent, therefore, from east to west, is rather more than 87
miles.&nbsp; On the low hills, it extends from the Kankayi to the
Kosi, which is about 48 miles.&nbsp; It includes very few or none
of the mountains, and none of the Alps.</p>
<p>The most remarkable places are as follows:</p>
<p>Vijaypur, the residence of the Subah, and of a former dynasty
of princes, is situated on the higher part of the low hills, and
is in so much exempt from the unhealthy air of that region called
Ayul, that the people, they say, can eat three-fourths more there
than they can in the lowlands; a manner of measuring the
salubrity of different places, which is in common use among the
natives, but, I suspect, is rather fanciful.&nbsp; The fort is
always garrisoned by regulars, and a Serdar very commonly resides
in it, superintends the conduct of the neighbouring civil
officers, and watches over the frontier.</p>
<p>Samrigarhi is another small fort still occupied.</p>
<p>Chaudanda, until the division of the principality founded by
Lohangga, was most commonly the seat of government.&nbsp; It is
now almost entirely deserted.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Satya Raja is a ruin, which is said to have been the
residence of a dynasty, that governed the country before the
ancestors of Vijaynarayan.</p>
<p>Kichak jhar is also a ruin, which is said to have been the
residence of Kichak, the brother-in-law of Virat, king of Matsya,
celebrated in Hindu legend.&nbsp; I am assured by the people of
the vicinity, that in a very thick wood at Kichak jhar there are
ruins.</p>
<p>At Sorahbag was the residence of the wife of Vijaybharat, the
last king of the dynasty, which preceded Lohangga.</p>
<p>Varaha kshetra is a temple dedicated to Vishnu, in the form of
a boar.&nbsp; During the government of the former dynasty, the
priests (Mahanta) of this temple seem to have had great weight;
and their successor enjoys some land, and the whole duties
collected at a neighbouring custom-house, (Chatra Gola.)&nbsp;
The place is still frequented by a good many pilgrims, but the
number has, of late, considerably diminished.&nbsp; This is a
place where holy persons sometimes bury themselves alive, and on
such occasions, are supposed to be endowed with the gift of
prophecy.&nbsp; The buildings are not considerable, and, of late,
have become ruinous.</p>
<p>The market places (Hats) are 24 in number, as will appear by
the map.</p>
<p>The Golas, or custom-houses, are frequently changing, and, of
late, have mostly been placed near the frontier, and removed from
the hills.</p>
<p>At present, Morang is divided into three Taluks, or
districts.&nbsp; Each is under the charge of a deputy collector,
or Fouzdar.&nbsp; The first has under him one Chaudhuri, or
Zemindar; the second has four Chaudhuris; and the third three
Chaudhuris.&nbsp; The land, under this Subah&rsquo;s authority,
is divided into Pergunahs.</p>

<p>No other crop pays any thing, and the tenantry pay no ground
rent for their houses.&nbsp; The Calcutta Biga is one-third of an
English acre, and the rupee weighs 179&frac12; grains of silver;
it is divided into 16 anas, and the ana into 12 pies.</p>
<p>The settlement in the year Sambat 1846, soon after the
conquest, was considerably lower, but more crops were
included.</p>
<p>The duties called Sayer include a capitation on artists, a
duty on the sale of oxen and buffaloes, on marriages, on the
contract with a concubine, on grain exported, on all things sold
at Hats or markets, and on adulterers.</p>
<p>The duty on Catechu I have already explained.</p>
<p>The management of the mines is not entrusted to the care of
the Subahs.</p>
<p>The whole amount which the Subah collected in the year
1809&ndash;10 is said to have been 131,425 rupees, out of which
the Subah pays 80,000 rupees to government; and his share of the
Rajangka, and presents to the twelve great officers of state,
usually amount to 20,000 rupees more; but this is probably
compensated by similar exactions that he makes from his
inferiors.&nbsp; He, however, incurs a heavy expense in
furnishing the regular troops with provisions, which he must do
at a price fixed by government, and which is always far below the
market price; but he squeezes a great part of this from the
neighbouring tenantry.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154"
class="citation">[154]</a> <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>estimates
the nett revenue of this territory, which he calls East Turrye,
at from 125,000 to 150,000 rupees, including, perhaps, Rajangka
and mines.</p>
<p>Each village (Gang) is under a Mokuddum, who has five <i>per
cent</i>. of the land free of rent; a Patwari or clerk, who has
one-half ana on the rupee of rent, and two anas a-year on each
house, both from the tenants, and gives one-half of this to his
superiors, the Mohurers, who are registers to the Fouzdars, and
to the Kanungo, who is register to the Subah.&nbsp; The
messengers (Gorayits) from every house get about two loads of the
ears of rice, which give about one <i>man</i> (82 lbs.
avoirdupois) of grain; so that, neither on account of the village
establishment, nor on that of the Kanungoes or his clerks,
(Mohurer,) is there any deduction from the above sum; but the
Subah pays several heavy establishments.</p>
<p>At his chief office, it amounts to about 3500 rupees
a-year.&nbsp; There are, besides the Fouzdars, Chaudhuris and
armed men, at the three subordinate divisions for the land rent
and sayer.</p>
<p>The Subah, being a merchant of Banaras, keeps the Catechu at
his own disposal, and, besides the duties, has probably much
profit on this article as a merchant.</p>
<p>The duties on timber are formed in three lots, to three
Fouzdars, and the nett proceeds only have been included.</p>
<p>The rents on pasture are farmed on the same plan to two
Fouzdars.</p>
<p>His whole establishment, therefore, does not probably exceed
7000 rupees a-year.</p>
<p>Two captains (Subahdars) have lands in the district for the
maintenance of 300 men.</p>
<p>The Subah, as judge, receives 25 <i>per cent</i>. on all sums
recovered in his court, but the greater part of this goes to the
Raja.&nbsp; The Subah, however, always receives presents <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>from the defendant, when the suit is given in his
favour, and he has fees in the management of the police.&nbsp;
The avowed profits, in the management of justice and police in
the year 1809&ndash;10, are said, in even numbers, to have been
15,000 rupees.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Vijaypur, towards the east, are chiefly
Koch or Rajbangsis, who are considered as the same, live on the
plain, and speak the dialect of Bengal; on the lower hills are
many Mech.&nbsp; Both these tribes are original inhabitants of
Kamrup.&nbsp; In the western parts, most of the cultivators are
of the Gangaye cast, who speak the dialect of Mithila, and adhere
to the doctrines of purity, as established in that country.&nbsp;
On the hills, the people are mostly Khas, or a mixed breed
between the mountain Hindus and natives, with some Rajputs, and
some Magars, who have been lately introduced.</p>
<p>The northern part of the eastern division of the principality,
founded by Lohangga, has been lately formed into a distinct
district, and its Subah resides at Chayenpur.&nbsp; The hilly
parts of Sikim, so far as has been subdued, and a portion of
Thibet, bordering on the Arun river, have been annexed to the
jurisdiction, which is bounded by the Sengkhuya Arun, and Kausiki
on the west, and by the Tista on the east, extending between 80
and 90 miles in these directions, and perhaps about 60 or 70 from
north to south.&nbsp; It consists altogether of lofty mountains,
rising, in many parts, to the most tremendous Alps.</p>
<p>The land revenue, I am told, is very trifling, the whole
almost being held by military tenure; but I did not learn the
particulars.&nbsp; The chief revenues are the customs at Golas,
mines, and capitation, (Rajangka,) but the two last are not
collected by the Subah.&nbsp; There is no Sayer.</p>
<p>The forts are Chayenpur, about two or three coses from the
<!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Arun, Changiya, Hedang, a large place towards the
frontier of Thibet, Darjiling, and Sikim.</p>
<p>The Golas, or custom-houses, are Ilam, Majhuya, Bilasi,
Tangting, Huchi-Mechi, Dimali, and Satang, all in the territory
formerly belonging to the Sikim Raja.&nbsp; The Gorkhalese have
no connection with Thibet in that quarter, because the route is
still in possession of the Sikim Raja.&nbsp; Chayenpur, however,
has a considerable trade with Thibet by that part of the country
which is near the Arun.&nbsp; Hatiya on the Arun, and Alangchang
on the Tambar, are at present the marts established for this
commerce.&nbsp; Formerly it was carried on at Pokang in the
middle between the two rivers.&nbsp; People can pass to the two
former all the year; the trade at Pokang was confined to
summer.&nbsp; The goods imported at these places from Thibet are
salt carried on sheep, gold, silver, musk, and musk-deer skins,
the tails called Chaungris, blankets, borax, Chinese silks, and
medicinal herbs.&nbsp; The goods sent from Chayenpur are rice,
wheat, maruya, (Cynosurus corocanus,) uya, a grain, oil, butter,
iron, copper, cotton cloths, broadcloth, catechu, myrobalans,
(harra bahara,) planks of the Dhupi, pepper, and spices, indigo,
tobacco, hides, otters&rsquo; fur, sugar-candy, and extract of
sugar-cane, occasionally some pearls.</p>
<p>The route from Vijaypur to Pokang is said to be as follows in
days journeys:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To Mulghat on the Tambar river.&nbsp; The road hilly,
but not mountainous.&nbsp; Much cultivation.&nbsp; No river of
note.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To Dhankuta, or Dhankot.&nbsp; The same kind of
country.&nbsp; Cross the Tambar.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To Ukhaliya.&nbsp; Country more hilly, and less
cultivated.&nbsp; Several small rivers, especially the
Mangmay.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; To Jaresang, a town in a plain well cultivated
country.</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>5.&nbsp; To the Leghuya river, where there is a fine
valley.&nbsp; The road passes over low hills.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; To Dobhang.&nbsp; The road hilly, but in many parts
cultivated.&nbsp; Cross the Piluya river below Chayenpur
Fort.&nbsp; Dobhang is situated on the Soyeya river, near where
it joins the Arun.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; To Tamlingtar, a smooth road fit for horses.&nbsp; It
stands between the Soyeya and the Arun, which are about 1&#8532;
coses distant from each other.&nbsp; This is the largest place in
the district, and is said to be about the size of Kirtipur, in
the valley of Nepal, which, I suppose, may contain 6000 people;
but Tamlingtar is not built with brick, as is the case with
Kirtipur.&nbsp; The plain round it is very considerable,
extending twelve coses north and south, and four coses east and
west.&nbsp; The plain is bounded on the west by the Arun, and is
not quite so cool as Kathmandu, nor is it fully cleared.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; To Tamling, a smooth road fit for horses.&nbsp;
Tamling is about three coses east from the Arun.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; To Segeya, a smooth road fit for horses.&nbsp; The
country is well cultivated.&nbsp; Segeya is a day&rsquo;s journey
east from the Arun.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; To Lum, a good road.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; To Jupha, a very hilly road with steep ascents and
descents, but much cultivation.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; To Jholangghat, on the Arun, where there is a bridge
suspended by rattans.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; To Hedang, the route being on low hills by the west
side of the Arun.&nbsp; West from Hedang two days journey, is
Meyangma, a snowy mountain, and at the same distance east is
another named Mirgu.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; To Komba, a village of Bhotiyas, at a distance from
the Arun, and formerly at least the residence of a Lama, who was
supposed to be an incarnation of God.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>15.&nbsp; To Chamtang, another village inhabited by
Bhotiyas, and at a distance from the Arun.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; To Seksula, or Seksura, on the Arun.&nbsp; Some
accounts place it on one side, and some on the other of the
Arun.&nbsp; It is a village of Bhotiyas, and part may be on each
side of the river, which is crossed on a bridge of rattans.</p>
<p>17 and 18 to Pokang.&nbsp; The country is not very hilly, but
so high and cold, that it is frequented only in summer by
shepherds and traders who attend the mart.</p>
<p>From Seksula, proceeding on the west side of the Arun, you
have,</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Hatiya, a Bhotiya village, where there is a
mart.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; Chipachintang, another Bhotiya village belonging to
Gorkha.&nbsp; A little way beyond it is Manigumba, a village
subject to Lasa.</p>
<p>The Arun here would seem to pass through the highest ridge of
the snowy mountains.&nbsp; The Kirat, who gave me the map of the
eastern parts of the principality, names the portion of these
mountains towards the east Papti, and says, that between it and
Mirgu, mentioned above, there is a large valley; but, except near
the Arun, it has no regular inhabitants.&nbsp; In summer it is
frequented by shepherds alone; but he would not appear to have
been acquainted with its eastern parts; for, though he admits
that the Tambar rises from Papti, and afterwards passes through
Mirgu, he knew nothing of the Gola that is there, and is called
Alangchang.&nbsp; South from Mirgu is another high ridge; but the
snow that occasionally falls on it in winter soon melts.&nbsp;
The Kirat calls it Ichhanglima; I have no doubt that it is the
Phakphok of the map made by the slave; for the Kirat says, that
the Kankayi rises from Mirgu, and passes through a gap in
Ichhanglima.&nbsp; The slave in his map says that Phakphok is the
proper source of the Kankayi, but admits, <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>that it
receives a stream from the snowy mountains.&nbsp; The Kirat
alleged that the hollow between Mirgu and Ichhanglima is
overgrown with immense forests occupied by elephants and
rhinoceroses, which is scarcely reconcilable with its necessary
elevation; and the compiler of the other map represents it as a
well inhabited country, which is the most probable account, as
the Kirat had not visited that part.</p>
<p>On the west side of the Arun, again, the Kirat places
Syamphelang as the highest ridge of snowy mountains, and he
seemed to think, that the very highest peak visible, and bearing
about N. by W. from Nathpur, was part of this mountain connected
with this, but leaving between them the valley watered by the
Tarun, is another snowy mountain, which the Kirat calls Meyangma,
but which the slave who constructed the map calls Salpa
pahar.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the eastern parts of Chayenpur have been
already mentioned.&nbsp; In the western parts the most numerous
tribe is Kirat, next Limbu, then Magar, lately introduced as
soldiers, then Khas and Rajputs.&nbsp; There are also Murmis, and
towards the N.W. Bhotiyas.</p>
<p>The middle part of the principality of Lohangga has also been
divided into two districts under Subahs.&nbsp; The first
comprehends the southern portion called Saptari, but the low land
between the Rato and Kamal, named Mahatari, which formerly
belonged to the western division of the principality, has lately
been placed under the authority of this Subah.&nbsp; His
jurisdiction, therefore, on the plain extends about 100 miles
from east to west, and its width there is nearly the same as that
of Morang; so that it possesses more level land.&nbsp; Very
little of the hilly country belongs to it, as Khatang and
Makwanpur come far down and meet at the Kamal.</p>
<p>The most remarkable places in this district are Naragarhi, a
<!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>small fort on the plain, where the Subah usually
resides; Bhemagarhi, another similar place, where he occasionally
resides; and Janakpur, a place of pilgrimage noted in Hindu
fable, and already mentioned as the seat of a very ancient
dynasty.&nbsp; I am told that there are no remains of former
power or greatness.</p>
<p>There are ten market-places.</p>
<p>The Golas, or custom-houses, are placed in the map.</p>
<p>The land-rent is collected by two Fouzdars, one for Saptari,
the other for Mahatari; but these also collect some trifling dues
which have not been let with the sayer or duties on markets; for
there is no regular system of finance.&nbsp; These dues are those
on marriages, (Bihadani,) on contracts of concubinage, (Sagora,)
and a fine on adulterers of rupees 2-10/16, levied by the
collector, besides the fine that goes to the Raja; for the man
who has farmed the duties on the markets takes a part of the
fine, amounting to rupees 2-10/16.&nbsp; The following will show
the sums collected on these heads in the year Sambat 1867, (A.D.
1809.)</p>

<p>There is only one mine of iron at Sisuya, near the Kosi.</p>
<p>The Tharu cast, resembling, in its manners, the Gangayi of
Morang, composes the greatest part of the population on the
plain.&nbsp; Next to these, are nearly equal parts of the impure
Bhawars, and of the military and agricultural tribe of Brahmans,
called Aniwar, both of whom have, at different times, been
sovereigns of the country.&nbsp; Immediately under the hills are
many Batars, who speak the Hindwi language.&nbsp; The lower hills
are occupied by Sringguyas, a branch of the Limbu tribe, and by
Magars, and Rajputs or Khas.&nbsp; The Magars have been lately
introduced.</p>
<p>The northern parts of this middle division of the principality
of Lohangga, form the jurisdiction of the Subah of Khatang, who
possesses an extensive region of mountains, bounded by the Arun
on the east, and on the west by the Tamba Kosi, which separates
it from the territory of Bhatgang, one of the three
principalities into which Nepal Proper was divided.&nbsp; Towards
the south it descends to the Kamal, which, in part, separates it
from Makwanpur.&nbsp; On the north it is bounded by the snow
hills, which separate it from Thibet or Lasa, and, in this part,
advance far south.</p>
<p>The land revenue has been almost entirely granted to the
different officers of the Gorkhalese government, and there is no
Sayer, nor customs, so that the Raja chiefly receives the income
tax, (Rajangka,) fines, and the profits of mines.&nbsp; The Subah
pays only 12,000 rupees a-year, and about 3000 rupees as
Rajangka.&nbsp; This district maintains two companies of 120
fusileers each.</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>The forts are Hedang, where the Subah resides;
Chaudandi, where the Rajas formerly lived; Rawa, near the
junction of the San and Dudh Kosis; Chariyagarhi, on the Kamal;
and Hatuya, at the junction of the San Kosi and Arun, where a
Serdar often has a military station.</p>
<p>At the temple of Siva in Halesi, where the Dudhkosi and
Sankosi unite, is a very great fair in February.</p>
<p>With Thibet there are two routes of communication.</p>
<p>On the Dudhkosi is Lamja, to which the Bhotiyas come at all
seasons.&nbsp; The Alps extend two day&rsquo;s journey beyond it,
on the banks of the Dudhkosi; afterwards there is a plain
country.&nbsp; The road from Kalesi to Lamja Gola is as
follows:</p>
<p>One day&rsquo;s journey to Rawa, a large town with a
fort.&nbsp; The country fully occupied.</p>
<p>One day to Hakula, a large village.&nbsp; The country here,
also, is well inhabited.</p>
<p>One day&rsquo;s journey to Jubing, a large village.</p>
<p>One day to Ghat, a village inhabited chiefly by Bhotiyas, the
climate being too cold for the mountain Hindus.</p>
<p>One day&rsquo;s journey from thence to Lamja, also inhabited
by Bhotiyas.&nbsp; The imports are as usual from that country,
but there are no duties.</p>
<p>The other route to Thibet, from this district, is towards
Dudhkunda, a place in Thibet, where there is a very great annual
fair.&nbsp; The road, commencing at Lengleng, at the junction of
the Tamha and San Kosi, is as follows:</p>
<p>One day to Namari, a large village.</p>
<p>One day to Jirikampti, where the Raja of Gorkha has 10,000 or
12,000 cows on fine plain land, kept waste on purpose.</p>
<p>One day to Gama, a large village inhabited by Bhotiyas.</p>
<p>One day to Goyang, a similar village.</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>One day to the snowy mountain Pangmo.&nbsp; Dudhkunda
is a little way among the Alps, but is subject to Thibet.</p>
<p>The commerce by the Tamba kosi goes by Phala, a Gola or
custom-house in the former territory of Bhatgang.</p>
<p>The roads from the San Kosi to the mountains are difficult,
but, for a part of the way, people can ride on horseback.</p>
<p>From Chatra to Nepal the road is rather better, but, in many
places, the rider must dismount.&nbsp; After, however, passing
the falls of the Kosi at Chatra, the San Kosi is navigable in
canoes, to the junction of the Risu, where it turns to the
north.&nbsp; The Arun is navigable to Hedang.</p>
<p>The best route, by land, from Chatra to Nepal, is as
follows:</p>
<p>On the first day&rsquo;s journey, cross the Kosi to Mayna, and
then the San kosi to Lasuniya.</p>
<p>A day&rsquo;s journey from Lasuniya to Kuta.</p>
<p>One day&rsquo;s journey to Khatang, which may be five or six
coses north from the San kosi.</p>
<p>From Khatang to Kamtel, one day.</p>
<p>To Halesi, at the junction of the Dudhkosi, one day.</p>
<p>To Teliya, about three coses from the San kosi, one day.</p>
<p>To Bangnam, on the west of the Lekho, one day.</p>
<p>To Chupulu, one day.</p>
<p>To Mantali ghat, on the Tamba kosi, one day.&nbsp; The village
is on the west side.</p>
<p>To Puchi ghat, on the San kosi, one day.</p>
<p>To Dumja, on the Rusi, one day.</p>
<p>To Dapcha, on the north side of the Rusi, one day.</p>
<p>To Banipa, at the head of the Rusi, on the hills that bound
the valley of Nepal, one day.</p>
<p>The mines in this district are numerous, as will appear from
the map.</p>
<p>There are no markets, (Hats,) but some shops in all the
towns.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>The chief place in Khatang is Dalka, on the Tamba kosi,
upon a plain extending to Puchigat, on both sides of the Tamba
kosi, and about a cose in width.&nbsp; This valley extends down
the San kosi, from one-half to one cose in width.&nbsp; Dalka is
a town like Timmi, in the valley of Nepal, which, I suppose, may
contain 4000 people, and is chiefly inhabited by Newars, and
built of brick.&nbsp; At it there is a celebrated temple of Bhim
Sen, one of the sons of Pandu.&nbsp; The Pujari is a Newar, and
the temple is considered as the eastern boundary of Nepal
Proper.</p>
<p>The most valuable district which the Raja of Nepal possesses,
is that which formed the western division of the principality,
founded by Lohangga, although the district called Mahatari has
been separated, and annexed to the Subah of Saptari.&nbsp; The
Subah of this district resides usually at Makwanpur, on the
hills, but, in the cold season, he visits the plains and resides
at Baragarhi, from whence he is often called the Baragarhi
Subah.&nbsp; His jurisdiction extends from the Rato, on the east,
to the Trisul Gangga, and Gandaki, on the west; and from the
Company&rsquo;s territory, on the south, to the San kosi, and
Rusi, on the north.&nbsp; In some parts, towards the north, this
boundary was disputed between the Rajas of Patan, in Nepal, and
the Rajas of Makwanpur.&nbsp; One would naturally have supposed,
that the boundary would have been determined by the mountain
called Lama dangra, which extends from the Trisul gangga to the
Arun, and which, except by the Vagmati or Vagwati, is crossed by
no river, all those from its north side falling into the Trisul
gangga, Vagmati, or Kosi.&nbsp; In fact, where I passed this
mountain at Chisapani, a little above the fort, I was shown an
old wall on the summit, which was said to have been the boundary;
but I am told, that the copper mine on the north side of the hill
belongs to Makwani, and that the boundary goes thence obliquely
towards <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the north-east, so that it includes
many villages between Lama Dangra, and the Rusi, and San kosi
rivers.</p>
<p>When Colonel Kirkpatrick visited Nepal, <a
name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a> it would appear that the Subah of
Makwanpur, or Baragarhi, governed the whole country from the Kosi
to the Gandaki, divided into five Zilas, which he names Subtuni,
(Saptari,) Mohtuni, (Mahatari,) Rohuttut or Rohtut, Bareh,
(Baragarhi,) and Persa, (Pasara.)</p>
<p>One-half of this territory is on the level country, called
Tariyani, and is exactly on the same footing with the level of
Morang, Saptari, and Mahatari.</p>
<p>About one-fourth of the district consists of low hills, very
thinly occupied; and one-fourth consists of high mountains.</p>
<p>The most remarkable places of strength are the fort of
Makwanpur, where the Rajas formerly dwelt; Hariharpur, commanding
the Vagmati; Sinduli, (Seedly R.) and Chisapani, commanding two
passages through the mountain called Lama dangra; Chayenpur, on
the San kosi; and Kumbi, Gar Pasara, Kurarbas and Baragarhi,
commanding the plain.&nbsp; Chisapani, the most important, and
Gar Pasara, both of which I have seen, are altogether
contemptible; and it is probable that the others are still
worse.&nbsp; Baragarhi, (Barra Gharry,) according to Colonel
Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation168b"></a><a href="#footnote168b"
class="citation">[168b]</a> is a mean place, containing 30 or 40
huts, and its fort is not more respectable than Gar Pasara.&nbsp;
In the whole district, there is not one considerable town.</p>
<p>At Hethaura, Sinduli, and Bichhakhori, customs are collected,
but none of them are marts for the sale of goods.&nbsp; On the
plain country are several markets, (Hats,) but I have not learned
the names nor situations of the whole.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>I did not learn the particulars of the revenue of this
district, but was told at Kathmandu, in a general way, that the
Subah pays annually 100,000 rupees.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169"
class="citation">[169]</a> estimates the money annually remitted
by the Subah at 200,000 rupees; but then this Subah held also
Saptari, which, paying now 58,000 rupees, should leave 142,000
for the present territory; but, in what Colonel Kirkpatrick
states as the remittance, the Rajangka was perhaps
included.&nbsp; There are, besides, many mines.&nbsp; The greater
part of the hills has been granted in Jaygir to various
officers.&nbsp; The plains alone are rented on account of the
court.</p>
<p>On the plains, the population consists chiefly of Tharus and
Aniwars.&nbsp; The great cast on the hills is the Murmi, and this
is also the case on the north of the valley of Nepal.&nbsp; About
the forts are some Rajputs, many of the spurious breed of Khas,
and a good many Magars.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this part of the Tariyani, which I had an
opportunity of seeing, are quite the same in their circumstances,
language, dress, persons, and customs, with the Hindus of the
northern part of Behar.&nbsp; The peasantry are extremely nasty,
and apparently indigent.&nbsp; Their huts are small, dirty, and
very ill calculated to keep out the cold winds of the winter
season, for a great many of them have no other walls but a few
reeds supported by sticks in a perpendicular direction.&nbsp;
Their clothing consists of some cotton rags, neither bleached nor
dyed, and which seem never to be washed.&nbsp; They are a small,
hard-favoured people, and by no means fairer than the inhabitants
of Bengal, who are comparatively in much better
circumstances.</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Having finished my account of the principality, founded
by Lohangga, the youngest son of Mukunda, in the eastern parts of
the territory, now subject to Gorkha, I proceed to give an
account of the territory adjacent to the west, which fell to the
lot of the other branches of the same family.</p>
<p>Makunda Sen the 1st, when he provided for his sons, gave
Champaranya to his brother, who left it to his son Rama Singha,
descended of whom was another Makunda Sen, whose son, or
grandson, is supposed to have been destroyed by the ghost of a
Brahman, whom he had offended, and the country now belongs to the
Raja of Betiya.&nbsp; This is an account given by Samar
Bahadur.&nbsp; Others say, that Rama Sen, or Rama Singha, was a
son of Makunda the 1st, who obtained Tilpur and Rajpur, both in
the Company&rsquo;s territory, as I intend hereafter to
describe.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned, that Binayak, said to be the eldest
son of Makunda, received the territory on the plain now called
Butaul.&nbsp; Jasu Sen, the son of Binayak, did nothing worth
remark, but left his patrimony to his son Damodar Sen, who, in
the same manner, begat Balabhadra Sen, and he begat Ambar Sen,
who succeeded to Palpa, the line of Manik having failed.&nbsp; He
was succeeded by his son Gandharba Sen, who begat Udyata Sen, but
survived his son, and was succeeded by Makunda Sen, his grandson,
who had wars with most of his neighbours, conquered Gulmi, and
recovered some of his dominions that had been seized by the Raja
of Gorkha.&nbsp; In the course of his wars with a Muhammedan
Nawab, he took some guns and flags, as trophies of victory.&nbsp;
He had five sons.&nbsp; 1. Mahadatta S. who succeeded.&nbsp; 2.
Suravir S.&nbsp; 3. Karuvir S.&nbsp; 4. Chandravir S.&nbsp; And,
5. Dhwajavir S.&nbsp; Mahadatta had three sons.&nbsp; 1. Prithwi
Pal S.&nbsp; 2. Rana Bahadur S.&nbsp; And, 3. Samar Bahadur
S.&nbsp; Prithwi Pal S. succeeded his <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>father, and
left one son named Ratna Sen, who is the present representative
of the family.&nbsp; This is the account contained in the
manuscript composed by Rana Bahadur, already mentioned.&nbsp; I
shall now give some farther detail.</p>
<p>Gandharba Sen of Palpa and Binayakpur made a considerable
addition to his dominions, having, with the assistance of his
allies, the Rajas of Gulmi and Kachi, seized on the territories
of an impure Magar chief, who resided at Balihang.&nbsp; This
chief, of whose family there are no remains, had large
possessions, both on the hills and plains, especially on the
latter.&nbsp; These were divided among the three allies, Palpa
taking the best share.&nbsp; There was a small territory,
however, called Khidim, about the division of which the three
chiefs could not agree.&nbsp; After much squabbling, it was
determined that it should be given to a Brahman, whose
descendants held it, until the country was seized by the late
Raja of Gorkha and Nepal, who gave it to his father-in-law, the
Raja of Gulmi.</p>
<p>Makunda Sen the 2d held Binayakpur Palpa and a great part of
Balihang, and was at the head of an alliance of petty chiefs,
composed of Gajarkot, Rising, Ghiring, Argha, Khachi, and Gulmi,
which last, after a vain attempt at conquest, he was obliged to
relinquish.&nbsp; Narabhupal, Raja of Gorkha, had married his
aunt, daughter of Gandarbha, and he received kindly at his court
his cousin Prithwi Narayan, the son of Narabhupal, while that
chief was a young man, very slenderly provided.&nbsp; One of
Prithwi&rsquo;s most early acts was to subdue the three first
mentioned allies of Makunda; but from their territories he was
soon expelled, and this is what in the manuscript is called
recovering part of his dominions from Gorkha.&nbsp; After the
death of Prithwi Narayan, his son Singha Pratap showed so much
favour to a Swarup Singha, <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>whom he had
raised from a low rank to the important office of Karyi, that, on
account of the envy which was excited, the favourite was under
the necessity of flying to the Company&rsquo;s territory.&nbsp;
There some European gentlemen took notice of him, and supported
him with money.&nbsp; Having introduced himself to the
unfortunate widow of Karna Sen, chief of the eastern branch of
the family, whose only child, as I have already mentioned, had
been poisoned by the intrigues of Prithwi Narayan, Swarup
obtained authority from this lady to proceed to Palpa for
assistance; and having gone there, Makunda gave him his youngest
son Dwaja vir to be adopted by the old lady, and to assert the
claims of his family.&nbsp; The melancholy fate of this youth has
been already detailed.&nbsp; At the time of his murder Swarup
Singha was at Calcutta, soliciting assistance.&nbsp; On his
return he was invited to Kathmandu, and all envy, it was said,
having died away, large promises were made, and the mother of the
Raja&rsquo;s heir gave an oath, that he should meet with no
harm.&nbsp; Immediately, however, after his arrival he was
confined, and in less than a year he was killed.</p>
<p>Makunda Sen procured from the Nawab Vazir a grant of the
extensive estate of Tilpur, and of that part of Rajpur, which is
on the west side of the Gandaki, and had once, as lately
mentioned, belonged to a branch of his family; but in the latter
he never acquired proper authority, owing to the intrigues of the
Kanungo, or register.</p>
<p>This enterprising chief married the eldest daughter (Maha
Kumari) of his ally the Raja of Argha, and on this occasion
presented his father-in-law with an estate situated on the plain,
and called Tuppah Bandar; although he continued to pay the
revenue to the Nawab.&nbsp; This was part of the spoil taken from
Balihang by his grandfather.</p>
<p>Mahadatta Raja of Palpa was very much in favour with <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Asofud Doulah, the Nawab Vazir, who confirmed to him
all his hereditary or acquired lands on the plains, at an easy
rate; and, going there frequently to hunt, seems to have amused
himself with the Raja&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; The youngest son
Samar, a lame but shrewd man, seems in particular to have
attracted his notice, and he bestowed on him the title of Nader
Shah, by which he is much better known than by his proper
name.</p>
<p>Mahadatta also entered into the strictest alliance with
Bahadur Sahi, younger son of Prithwi Narayan, and regent of
Gorkha during the minority of his nephew Rana Bahadur.&nbsp; In
order to cement the friendship, Mahadatta gave his daughter in
marriage to the regent, which, on account of her birth, was
considered as a very honourable connexion for the chief of
Gorkha.&nbsp; These friends soon entered into a most iniquitous
combination.&nbsp; The Gorkha family had hitherto entirely failed
in all their attempts to extend their dominions to the west, and,
if Palpa had continued to assist the neighbouring Rajas, it is
probable, that their resistance to Gorkha might have been
continued with success; but the father and son-in-law agreed,
that they should make a common cause, and divide the spoil.&nbsp;
This scheme completely succeeded, and Damodar Pangre, a Khas by
birth, but representative of one of the chief families in Gorkha,
and a most gallant officer, was sent in command of the
regent&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp; After the conquest, Damodar took for
his master the lion&rsquo;s share, but allowed Mahadatta to
retain as master Gulmi, Argha, and Kachi, three of the states
that had been long in alliance with his family, and which he was
bound to protect, not only by the duty of alliance, but of
kindred, for the Raja of Argha was his uncle.&nbsp; The other
three allies, who had been saved by his father, were abandoned to
the power of Gorkha, and annexed to Nepal.&nbsp; Mahadatta was
very soon forced to eat the fruit of his villany.&nbsp; Damodar
advanced the conquests of his nation <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to the
west, and, having subdued Kumau, all resistance to his force on
the hills was in vain, and Mahadatta was soon deprived of all the
hope of protection, that he might have had from the power of his
son-in-law the regent, the young Raja of Gorkha having put his
uncle to death.&nbsp; The friendship of the Nawab Vazir, however,
saved Mahadatta, nor was any encroachment made on Palpa, so long
as he lived.</p>
<p>Prithwi Pal succeeded his father, when very young, and was
endowed with great personal vigour, nor was he, I believe, at all
scrupulous about means; but he seems to have been rash and
credulous, which rendered him totally unable to resist the wiles
of the people of Gorkha, who were afraid to use open violence, on
account of his connexion with the Nawab Vazir.&nbsp; They did not
therefore molest his ancient dominions, nor any of the territory
that he had acquired on the plains, all of which was tributary to
the Nawab; but, immediately after his accession, Rana Bahadur,
king of Gorkha and Nepal, compelled the Raja of Palpa to restore
the mountains of Gulmi to Siddhi Pratap, the legal heir of that
country, whose sister Rana Bahadur had married.</p>
<p>When Rana Bahadur of Gorkha determined to place the
sovereignty in the hands of Yuddha Vikram Sahi, his illegitimate
son, he invited Prithwi Pal to perform the ceremony of Tika,
under pretence that he was desirous of obviating the defects of
his son&rsquo;s birth, by having the mark of royalty placed on
his forehead by a person of Prithwi Pal&rsquo;s high rank; for,
among the hill chiefs he was considered as the most eminent by
birth, and the Raja of Yumila had been expelled from his
dominions; nor did the Gorkha family, after the acquisition of
Nepal, acknowledge the superiority of its chief.&nbsp; The real
object, however, of the invitation, was in all probability to
have power over Prithwi Pal; for he remained in a kind of <!--
page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>confinement until January 1803, when the noble and
high-spirited lady, wife of Rana Bahadur, who then governed
Nepal, had the magnanimity to allow him to return to his own
territories, although his father had treacherously stript hers of
his dominions, and, although there is strong reason to suspect,
that Damodar Pangre, discontented with the illegitimacy of Yuddha
Vikram, had entered into a conspiracy to dethrone that young
prince, and to place Prithwi Pal on the throne of Nepal.</p>
<p>When Rana Bahadur had returned from Banaras, had assumed the
management of affairs, as regent for his son, and had put to
death Damodar Pangre, and the other discontented nobles of his
kingdom, his first care was to secure Prithwi Pal.&nbsp; He
accordingly sent an embassy to that chief, requesting his sister
in marriage, and making the most profuse offers of increasing the
territories of his future brother-in-law.&nbsp; The lady was
sent, accompanied by her brother Rana Bahadur, for Prithwi Pal
was suspicious; and, although invited, did not attend.&nbsp; The
lady and her brother were most kindly received by Rana Bahadur of
Gorkha, who said to the chief of the same name, I have been a
king, and should therefore think myself degraded by worshipping
you, (according to the Hindu custom,) when I received your sister
from your hands; it will be therefore highly agreeable to me, if
your brother, who is a prince my superior in birth, would attend
to give away his sister.&nbsp; The Guru, or spiritual guide of
the Palpa Raja, was in the suite of the princess, and was
dispatched in order to persuade Prithwi Pal, in which he
succeeded, by declaring, that Rana Bahadur had before him taken
the most solemn oaths to do his guest no injury.&nbsp; Whether
Rana Bahadur had actually done so, or whether the Brahman was
bribed, and told a falsehood to obtain his end, I cannot take
upon myself to say, <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>either circumstance being abundantly
compatible with the characters of the persons; but Prithwi Pal
had no sooner reached Kathmandu, with about 400 attendants, than
these were disarmed, he and his principal officers were put in
close confinement, and no more mention was made of the
marriage.&nbsp; No one can pity the fate of Prithwi Pal; as, in
order to ingratiate himself with his intended brother-in-law, he
took with him, and delivered to Rana Bahadur, the widow and only
surviving son of his friend Damodar Pangre; who, when that
gallant veteran and his elder sons had been murdered by the
tyrant, had fled to Palpa for refuge.&nbsp; The Raja of Gorkha
was, however, afraid of driving the Palpa family to extremities,
and compelling it to seek refuge in the territories of the
Company, which had received from the Nawab Vazir the sovereignty
of the low countries belonging to Palpa, and might be disposed to
give its powerful support.</p>
<p>When mortally wounded by his brother, the Raja of Gorkha
placed the authority of the kingdom, and the protection of his
son, in the hands of Bhim Sen, a very vigorous rash young man,
who, owing partly to the moderation of the Company&rsquo;s
negotiations with Rana Bahadur, by him attributed to fear, and
partly to the hope of protection from the Chinese, seems to have
beheld the British government with contempt.&nbsp; One of his
first measures, about the end of June 1804, was to put the Raja
of Palpa and all his officers to death.&nbsp; It is said by some
that, under pretence of the conspiracy to which I have alluded,
he inflicted most severe tortures on the unfortunate chief; but
others maintain, that his throat was cut, like that of the
others, without any form of investigation or delay.&nbsp; Bhim
Sen acted with the utmost promptitude in obtaining his
object.&nbsp; His father, Amar Singha, was raised to the English
rank of general, sent with a considerable force, and in less than
a <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>month from his son&rsquo;s elevation, took possession
of Palpa without resistance; nor did he hesitate to advance into
the low country, which belonged to the Raja of Palpa, as a
subject of the Company.&nbsp; Had Bhim Sen confined himself to
the hills of Palpa, it is almost certain that he would have met
with no disturbance from the British government; but he still
perhaps congratulates himself on having understood the British
government better than Rana Bahadur; for, although he has not
been allowed to keep undisturbed all the low country that was
subject to Palpa, he has for some years held a considerable
portion.</p>
<p>On the approach of General Amar Singha to Palpa, in July or
August 1804, the widow of Prithwi Pal, with her son Ratna Sen,
his uncle Samar Bahadur, usually called the Lal Dewan, or Nader
Shah, and his grand-uncle Suravir, who held the office of
Chautariya, fled to a house which the family had at Madhuvani in
Tilpur.&nbsp; The unfortunate lady died there, and the Raja was
removed to Gorakhpur, where he has ever since remained, but in
such constant apprehension of assassination, that it has been
judged necessary to have his house secured by a guard of regular
seapoys.&nbsp; The Company have allowed him a pension in lieu of
the profits which he would have had from his remaining estates,
of which the collector has assumed the entire disposal; for owing
to the encroachments made by Amar Singha, and the devastation
that has followed in what remains, it is altogether impossible
for him to fulfil the engagements into which his father&rsquo;s
agents entered with Mr Rutlege, the gentleman who had the
management of the country ceded by the Nawab vazir to the
Company.&nbsp; This pension was altogether inadequate to support
the number of persons by whom he was followed; and even his
venerable grand-uncle Suravir, son of Makunda Sen, suffered such
mortifications, <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>that he had determined to perish on
the place where his son had suffered death, for this youth had
accompanied his cousin Prithwi Pal.&nbsp; The old man, after
taking an affectionate leave of some of the family adherents in
Tilpur, and weeping with them a whole day, went to Palpa and
presented himself to Amar Singha, who was moved with compassion,
and said, though we have killed your son, and overthrown your
family, we will do you no injury, but will provide for you in a
manner very different from your friends the English.&nbsp; There
has accordingly been settled on him an income sufficient to
supply his wants.&nbsp; I am not sure that this has proceeded
from generosity; but it has produced some effect on the minds of
the populace.&nbsp; If it was intended to lull the fears of the
family into a fatal security, it has hitherto completely
failed.</p>
<p>The extent and boundaries of Palpa will be better seen from
the maps than explained by description.&nbsp; The country,
independent of Butaul, is in general lower and warmer than the
valley of Nepal Proper.&nbsp; The greatest crop is transplanted
rice, next to that broadcast rice, then maize, then the pulse
called urid, almost equal in quantity to the maize, then the
Lathyrus sativus, called dubi kerao, then the Eleusine corocanus,
or maruya, then the Ervum lens, or masuri, then four kinds of
sesamum, and the cruciform oil seeds, like mustard and rape, then
three kinds of the pulse called kurthi, and then a little of the
grains called sama and kodo.&nbsp; Much ginger is reared.&nbsp;
The sugar-cane grows very large and juicy, but is eaten without
preparation.</p>
<p>When the colony from Chitaur first took possession of Palpa,
it belonged to a Magar chief, and the people were of that
tribe.&nbsp; Brahmans, but mostly of the spurious breed called
Jausi, are now the most numerous class; next to these are the
Khas; and the Magars only occupy the third place.</p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>Since the Raja of Gorkha and Nepal has seized on this
country, the seat of government has been removed to Tansen, a
town at some distance west from Palpa, with a tolerable road
between them.&nbsp; This is now the residence of the General Amar
Singha, formerly called Thapa, and the Subahs, or civil officers,
governing the petty principalities to a considerable distance,
are under his authority.&nbsp; He has with him a large force of
regulars, (fourteen or fifteen companies,) which he has for some
time been assiduously increasing, and to enable him to put this
measure into execution, a great part of the free land has been
resumed.&nbsp; The plan adopted on this occasion was to say to
the Brahmans who held the land, &ldquo;you are impure fellows,
who have degraded yourselves by doing many things totally
inconsistent with the character of the sacred order.&nbsp; It is
impossible, therefore, that you should, as such, be permitted to
hold lands; and if you presume to act in the character from which
you have degraded yourself, you shall be scourged.&nbsp; For a
subsistence, therefore, betake yourself to cultivation; or other
drudgeries for which alone you are now fit, and do not bring a
disgrace on the character of the sacred order.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
these degenerate days perhaps there is not one Brahman out of
fifty who either does not do what he ought to shun, or who does
not omit to do what he ought to perform; and all will admit that
degraded Brahmans are unworthy of holding such possessions.&nbsp;
If the Brahmans, however, were to be the judges of the quantum of
such transgressions necessary to occasion the forfeiture of free
lands, such an event would seldom indeed happen.&nbsp; But the
lay rulers of Nepal judged more strictly; and as they knew that
whatever proofs they might bring would produce no conviction,
they probably deemed it quite unnecessary to put the parties to
any trouble, or to go through the farce of a trial, where the
measure to be adopted was <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>predetermined; nor are the chiefs of Nepal men against
whom any complaints of injustice are made by those under their
authority.</p>
<p>There are many routes from the plain into the hills of Palpa;
but, except by a few smugglers, most of these have been deserted
since the conquest, for which there seem to be two reasons.&nbsp;
The Nepalese are desirous of having only a few open routes, by
which an army from the low country might penetrate into the
hills, and they think that in a few years the neglected routes
will be either altogether forgotten, or be so overgrown with
woods as to prevent access.&nbsp; The few remaining roads will
then be easily guarded by a small force.&nbsp; But besides the
military point of view, they are desirous of having few passages
as a point of economy in collecting the customs.&nbsp;
Accordingly, so far as they can, they have stopt every pass,
except that by Butaul, which, of course, has become a
considerable mart, although most inconveniently situated.&nbsp;
It stands on the plain, but in a recess of the mountains, and is
so dreadfully unhealthy, that no one resides there in the rainy
season.&nbsp; The Rajas had a house called Nayakot on a hill
overhanging the town, or assemblage of huts; but I am told, that
this castle is not sufficiently elevated to be exempt from the
effects of the insalubrious air.</p>
<p>The Palpa Rajas possessed also a very important mart in the
hills.&nbsp; It is called Rerighat, and is situated on the bank
of the Narayani.&nbsp; The best, or rather the only tolerable
roads passing through the country either from the east and west,
or from the north and south, pass this route; and it seems to be
of equal importance either in a military or commercial
view.&nbsp; During the cold season there is at Rerighat a fair
(Mela) which lasts for three or four months, and is frequented by
a great number of traders from all parts of the mountains.&nbsp;
The road from <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Butaul to Rerighat by Morihang,
Mosihang, and Tansen, was said to be far from difficult; but what
idea a mountaineer annexed to a difficult road is not easy to
determine.&nbsp; Some of them say, that loaded oxen could pass;
others say that they could not.&nbsp; It is generally admitted,
that the easiest route from Rerighat to the plains would be east
through Tansen, Rampur, Nayakot, and Dewghat, but this road is at
present stopt.</p>
<p>Loaded canoes, I am assured, can pass up the Gandaki, or
Narayani, all the way to Rerighat, except at a narrow rapid
between two rocks at a place called Gongkur, a little above
Dewghat.&nbsp; There they must be unloaded and dragged up
empty.&nbsp; Timber in floating down this passage is apt to fall
across the channel, and to stick between the rocks; but this may
be obviated by tying a rope to one end of the logs so as to allow
them to float end on.&nbsp; Canoes can ascend to Dewghat with
little difficulty.&nbsp; There are, indeed, three rapids; one
above Bhelaunji to which large boats can go with ease; a second
at the junction of the Arhung; and a third at Khairiyani, near
Dewghat; but in the dry season canoes or small boats may be
dragged up loaded.&nbsp; In floods the navigation is altogether
unadvisable, the river being then of tremendous rapidity.</p>
<p>Near Tansen, the present capital, there was formerly a mine of
iron, but, since the conquest, copper has been discovered in the
same place, and now, it is said, the mine produces that metal to
the value of 50,000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; In the small territory
of Khidim lately, as I have said, annexed to Palpa, is a mine of
lead.</p>
<p>I received very little information concerning the Tanahung
branch of this family.&nbsp; It is said to be descended of
Bihangga, or Bhringga, son of Makunda Sen, who lived ten or
eleven generations ago.&nbsp; After some generations the then
chief of <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Tanahung, it is said, gave Rising as
an appanage to a younger brother, although, as I shall afterwards
state, there may be some doubt entertained on this point.&nbsp;
Afterwards, on the failure of the Champaranya, or Rajpur branch
of this colony from Chitaur, the then Raja of Tanahung secured a
part called Ramnagar, which is situated in the district of Saran,
under the protection of the Company, and is now all that belongs
to the family.&nbsp; No chief resisted with such gallantry and
effect the rising power of Prithwi Narayan of Gorkha as the Raja
of Tanahung, by whom the forces of that perfidious prince were
defeated in a most decisive battle; nor was any attempt
afterwards made to extend the dominions of Gorkha to the west
until the Raja of Palpa was gained, as I have already
mentioned.&nbsp; How the overthrow of Tanahung took place I have
not learned; but the Raja made his escape to Ramnagar, and
retains only what he held of the Company.&nbsp; His country, that
was formerly independent, consists of two portions; one on the
hills that surround Gorkha on the west and south, and one in the
valley of the Raputi, which is adjacent to the southern portion
of what is on the hills.&nbsp; This valley is inhabited by the
ordinary Hindus of Mithila.&nbsp; It contains three Pergunahs or
baronies, Chitan, Belan, and Sengjhayat, of which the two former
contain a good deal of cultivation.&nbsp; The road through them
along the Raputi to Hethaura is tolerably level, and might be
easily made good; while I understand that from Ramnagar by
Bakraghat there is a pretty good road to Chitan over the low
hills, by which the valley is bounded on the south.&nbsp; The
direct road from the plain to Hethaura by Bichhakhori is, I know,
very difficult; but some allege, that there is along the banks of
the torrent, in which the road now goes, a very good route, which
has been shut up by the present government of Nepal.&nbsp;
Colonel Kirkpatrick describes <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>another
route through these hills; but, from all accounts, it is more
difficult than any of the others.</p>
<p>The mountains of Tanahung were inhabited by the same races as
Palpa, and nearly in the same proportions.&nbsp; Its southern
division contained three towns, Yogimara, Upadrang, and Kavilas;
the first of which is said to be large, and a military station of
some importance, although I did not learn the title of the
officer commanding, nor the extent of his force.&nbsp; The
circumstance of the military station, however, strongly confirms
the statement of Samar Bahadur, who alleges, that by these three
towns is one of the easiest routes to Nepal, of which the
following is a detail given by Sadhu Ram.</p>
<p>From Sivapur Ghat on the Gandaki, in the Company&rsquo;s
territory, to Bhelongji in Nepal, the distance is 2&frac12;
coses, very bad road, but large boats can go up the river.&nbsp;
From Bhelongji to Benmohar the distance is 3 coses, the river
having some rapids.&nbsp; Near Benmohar the Raputi joins the
Gandaki or Narayani; and there is a road through a level country,
partly cultivated, to Hethaura.&nbsp; From Benmohar to the Arung
Dumohan the distance is 3 coses.&nbsp; At this place also are
some rapids.&nbsp; From Arun Dumohan to Leraghat is a distance of
3&frac12; coses without rapids.&nbsp; From Leraghat to Dewghat
are two days&rsquo; journey, having the cultivated lands of
Chitan to the right, and Nawalpur, the residence of a Subah, to
the left.&nbsp; From Dewghat to Kavilas is one day&rsquo;s
journey east through a hilly country, in some parts
cultivated.&nbsp; Kavilas is a village near the Trisul Gangga,
which is larger than the Narayani above Dewghat.&nbsp; From
Kavilas to Upadrang is a day&rsquo;s journey through a hilly
country.&nbsp; Upadrang is a town and military station, with the
Trisulgangga one-quarter cose to the north.&nbsp; It must be
observed, that Kanak Nidhi reverses the situation of the two last
places; but Sadhu Ram&rsquo;s position is supported <!-- page
184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>by
Colonel Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; From Upadrang to Yogimara, or
Yogimaya, is a day&rsquo;s journey east.&nbsp; Yogimara is a
large village on a hill one-quarter cose south from the
Trisulgangga.&nbsp; From Yogimara to Chitlang, in the lesser
valley of Nepal, is two days&rsquo; journey; and the road seems
to pass through the valley, which Colonel Kirkpatrick calls Doona
Baisi, and fully describes. <a name="citation184"></a><a
href="#footnote184" class="citation">[184]</a>&nbsp; From his
account it would appear, that, from this valley, besides the
route leading to Chitlong, there is another leading to Thankot in
the greater valley of Nepal, and avoiding the difficult passage
of Chandangiri, which lies between Chitlong and Kathmandu.&nbsp;
Samar Bahadur says, that on the whole route there is no great
ascent; but the Brahman Prati Nidhi alleges, that the route is
both circuitous and steep.&nbsp; At any rate, it has been stopt
by the present government of Nepal.</p>
<p>In the western wing of Tanahung were the capital and Bandi,
two places of some consequence.&nbsp; The two maps differ a good
deal in the details of this principality; nor do I know to which
the preference should be given.</p>
<p>The mountains of Tanahung contained mines of iron, but no
others.</p>
<p>It was said, by Samar Bahadur, that Rising, Ghiring, and
Gajarkot, formerly belonged to Tanahung, and were given as an
appanage to a younger brother, among whose descendants they were
afterwards subdivided, and the three chiefs, to whom they
belonged, are universally looked upon to be of the same family;
but here a great difficulty occurs.&nbsp; The Tanahung family, as
well as the Palpa branch, is very generally admitted to be
descended of the Chitaur family, and to be <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>of the
highest and purest tribe on the hills, east of the river Kali;
but these three petty chiefs wallow in all the ancient
abominations of the mountaineers.&nbsp; That Samar Bahadur was
mistaken, I see no reason to suppose; especially as these three
chiefs were in league with his family, and as Rising seems to
have belonged to his ancestor Makunda the 1st, who founded at the
Dewghat, in that territory, a celebrated temple, where he
died.&nbsp; I shall not take upon myself, however, to say,
whether we are, from the circumstance, to infer, that the whole
members of this family have no just claim to be descended from
the Chitaur colony, but were impure mountaineers, who had this
pedigree invented to flatter them, when they turned from their
impure ways, and were induced to follow the Brahmans.&nbsp; It is
possible, that the first chief of the Rising family, who obtained
that country as an appanage, may have been of illegitimate birth,
and that, his mother being impure, he may have been brought up in
a hankering after the flesh-pots, from which it has been
impossible to wean his descendants.</p>
<p>Rising, as I have said, was given by a Raja of Tanahung to a
younger son.&nbsp; The territory was always petty, and, according
to Prati Nidhi, Dewghat seems to have been resumed by Tanahung;
but Sadhu Ram alleges, that so long as the principality of Rising
continued independent, Dewghat was its port, and enjoyed some
trade, which has been stopt by its present rulers.&nbsp; The
image of Siva, contained in the temple, is called Makundeswar,
from the founder.&nbsp; There is a great assembly of votaries on
the Sivaratri, and another on the Khichri.&nbsp; Some of this
family are said to remain, but where, I have not heard.&nbsp; The
country and its inhabitants do not differ materially from Palpa,
but it contains no mines.</p>
<p>Ghiring and Gajarkot, which belonged to two collateral <!--
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>branches of Rising, were still more petty than that
state, but did not differ in any other considerable respect.</p>

<p>I must next proceed to describe Nepal Proper, which is bounded
on the east, south, and south-west, by the territory above
mentioned.&nbsp; I have to regret, that various restraints, by
which my inquiries were checked, while at Kathmandu, prevented me
from obtaining much information that I was anxious to
procure.&nbsp; In particular, I obtained little or no information
concerning the history of the princes who governed Nepal at the
time of the conquest; except that the Newars had been long
subject to a family of their own nation, all the members of which
assumed the name of Mal, and, for some time previous to the
conquest, had separated into three lordships, Kathmandu or
Kathmaro, Lalita Patan, and Bhatgang, which circumstance greatly
facilitated the enterprise of the chief of Gorkha.</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Nepal is a country celebrated in Hindu fable, and is
said to be written thus in the Purans, attributed to Vyas; but in
the country itself, it is commonly said, that its proper name is
Niyampal, derived from a certain Niyam, a Muni, or very holy
person, the Nymuni of Colonel Kirkpatrick. <a
name="citation187a"></a><a href="#footnote187a"
class="citation">[187a]</a>&nbsp; This, however, is probably some
modern conceit, as the Brahmans of both south and north agree in
writing the name Nepala, or Nepal, and as the fables on which
this etymology is built, as Colonel Kirkpatrick justly observes,
<a name="citation187b"></a><a href="#footnote187b"
class="citation">[187b]</a> merit no attention.</p>
<p>As I myself procured little or no historical account of Nepal
Proper, previous to its conquest by the Raja of Gorkha, I might
altogether refer on the subject to Colonel Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s
account, contained in his eighth chapter; but for the sake of
connection, and in order to communicate my opinions on the
subject, I shall here give an abstract of Colonel
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s account, referring to his own work for
particulars.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation187c"></a><a
href="#footnote187c" class="citation">[187c]</a> quotes books,
which he calls Hurrumunt Khund and Ooter Khund, probably portions
of the Sri Bhagwat, for copious details concerning Nepal, during
the time that it continued one of the favourite haunts of the
Hindu deities, that is, during the Satya Yug, or Golden age; nor
have we any reason to regret, that, instead of detailing such
idle fables, he has contented himself with a mere reference to
this work.&nbsp; Afterwards he goes on to give a series of
princes, who are said to have governed Nepal in subsequent ages,
commencing with Niyam Muni, or as he writes Nymuni.&nbsp; In this
part of his work Colonel Kirkpatrick quotes no authority; but, as
he brings the lists down to the termination of the Newar dynasty
in 1767, his authorities are probably quite modern, <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>and, as he supports the doctrine of the Newars having
come from Gar Samaran, which they deny, his authorities must be
founded on the legends of the Brahmans, much of which probably
may be inventions perfectly recent, but some foundation may have
been taken from ancient works, mangled to suit them for modern
systems of Hindu chronology.</p>
<p>However this may be, Niyam Muni and his eight descendants are
said <a name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a"
class="citation">[188a]</a> to have governed during the Treta and
Dwapar Yugs, or the Silver and Brazen Ages, which, according to
the present system, lasted for many hundred thousand years.&nbsp;
The eight successors of Niyam Muni governed <a
name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b"
class="citation">[188b]</a> four hundred and ninety-one one-third
years, which requires rather an unwarrantable stretch of faith to
believe; but, even admitting this, what remains to Niyam Muni is
altogether beyond measure.&nbsp; This, perhaps, is owing to the
works originally consulted having been composed before the
present system of chronology was invented.&nbsp; It is more to
the purpose to observe, that these princes have Sangskrita names,
and therefore probably came from the plains; and that, except
Niyam and his immediate successor, all of them are called Gupt;
which shows that they were of the cow-herd tribe.</p>
<p>This dynasty was deprived of power by Bhul Singh of the Rajput
tribe, and descended of Mehip Gopal, who came from Semrounghur
(Gar Samaran) and Jamnukpou, (Janakipur.)&nbsp; He and his two
descendants both having Sangskrita names, governed a hundred and
eleven seven-twelfth years.&nbsp; Gar Samaran, it must be
observed, was not built for many ages after the time of this
dynasty; but Bhul Singh may have come from Janakipur, which was
in the vicinity of the place where Gar <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Samaran was
afterwards built.&nbsp; Whatever title these princes may have
assumed, there is no reason to suppose that they were of the
ancient Kshatriyas, descended of the sun, who resided at
Janakipur, and governed Mithila, as no such name as Mehip Gopal
appears in any list of the princes of Mithila that I have
seen.&nbsp; Indeed, the title Gopal rather implies, that, like
the former dynasty, the descendants of Mehip belonged to the low
tribe of cow-herds.</p>
<p>This dynasty, whatever may have been its origin, was expelled
by the Kerrats, (Kiratas,) of whom 27 princes governed 1630
years.&nbsp; The names of these princes, as might be expected,
from what I have said of the tribe Kirata, are entirely
barbarous.</p>
<p>The barbarian Kiratas were expelled by Nevesit, a Chetree
(Kshatriya) of the Surejbunsi (Suryabangsi) race, of whose
descendants 33 princes governed 1702 years.&nbsp; These princes
had Sangskrita names, although Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation189a"></a><a href="#footnote189a"
class="citation">[189a]</a> speaking of one of them, who built
the temple of Sambhunath, says, that they were Thibetians, who,
after having been expelled by the Newars, obtained the name of
Khat Bhotiyas, which they preserve to this day.&nbsp; Many of
them took the title of Burmah, <a name="citation189b"></a><a
href="#footnote189b" class="citation">[189b]</a> on which account
Colonel Kirkpatrick calls them Burmahs, probably meaning Varmas;
and it is probable that these are the Varmas celebrated in the
Purans, and had no connection with the Burmas of Ava, as Dr
Leyden supposed. <a name="citation189c"></a><a
href="#footnote189c" class="citation">[189c]</a>&nbsp; Both,
indeed, were of the sect of Buddha, who are usually called
Brahmas by the Hindus, and the word Burma, Burmah, or Birmah, is
probably a corruption of that appellation.</p>
<p>The Ahirs, (Ahiras, another name for cow-herds,) who were <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>originally the sovereigns of Nepal, then recovered
their dominions, and three of them governed 175 years.&nbsp;
These must have been descendants of Niyam Muni.&nbsp; They have
Sangskrita names, with the addition of Gupt, to mark their
descent and tribe.</p>
<p>After these the Burmahs, descended of Nevesit, again recovered
Nepal, and during 46 reigns governed 1869-1/6th years, which, by
some error in the printing, or addition, is made 2869-1/12
years.&nbsp; Three sons of the last of these 46 princes governed
successively, but the length of their reigns is not stated.&nbsp;
One of them left a daughter, named Suttey Naik Deby, (probably
Satya Nayeka Devi,) and married to Harrir Chander Deo, (probably
Harihara Chandra Deva,) Raja of Banaras, by whom she had a
daughter, Raj Letchmi, (Raya Lakshmi,) who was queen of
Nepal.</p>
<p>This lady was succeeded by Hurr Singh Deo Raja of Semrour,
(Hari Singha Deva of Samaran,) who introduced the Newars, and <a
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a> expelled the Thibetians, now called
Kath Bhotiyas, who since occupy chiefly the mountains near
Kuti.&nbsp; This event happened in the Newar year 444, (A.D.
1323.)</p>
<p>The length of time allotted in the preceding account to these
reigns is quite inadmissible, and on an average, I think, that
more than ten years should not be allowed for each.&nbsp;
According to this, we may form the following estimate.</p>
<p>Niyam and his eight descendants would govern 90 years,
beginning A.D. 33, nearly about the time that Sakya introduced
the doctrine of the Buddhas into these mountainous regions, and
it was he who probably introduced Sangskrita names, and any
considerable degree of civility among the mountain tribes.&nbsp;
We know abundantly, that most of the <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>successors
of Niyam continued to adhere to the doctrine of Sakiya, as the
Kiratas Burmahs and Newars occupy by far the greatest portion of
the subsequent space, and were no doubt of the sect of
Bouddha.</p>
<p>The three descendants of Mehip Gopal would govern 30 years,
beginning A.D. 173.</p>
<p>The Kiratas would govern 270 years, commencing A.D. 303.</p>
<p>The Bhotiyas, descended of Nevesit, would govern at first 330
years, beginning A.D. 473.</p>
<p>The descendants of Niyam Muni, after recovering their old
patrimony, would govern 30 years, beginning A.D. 803.</p>
<p>The Bhotiyas would again govern 490 years, beginning A.D.
833.</p>
<p>In the account of the Newars I have already stated, that this
people totally deny their having come from the plains, or that
their princes were descended of Hari Singha of Gar Samaran, and
the people of Mithila, in which Gar Samaran is situated,
altogether deny that Hari Singha ever left their country.&nbsp; I
am therefore inclined to suppose, that the Mal family, which
afterwards governed Nepal, are in fact the descendants of the
last queen of the Burmah race, who, under the influence of her
father from Banaras, may have introduced the doctrine of cast,
and other customs, in which the Newars differ from the
Thibetians, and thus separated their subjects from that portion
of their tribe who retained their ancient customs, and who were
afterwards distinguished by the name of Khat Bhotiyas.</p>
<p>Jat Mull, according to Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation191"></a><a href="#footnote191"
class="citation">[191]</a> in the sixth generation from the
founder of the Newar dynasty, was a <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>great
conqueror; but divided his kingdom into the three principalities
which existed when the country was conquered by the
Gorkhalis.&nbsp; Runjeet Mull (Ranjit Mal) of Bhatgang, in the
seventh generation from Jat Mull, entered into a league with
Prithwi Narayan of Gorkha against Kathmandu, which ended in the
total subjugation of his house in the year 1767, so that thirteen
generations held the government for 444 years, which coincides
very exactly with the calculation of the venerable Herodotus.</p>
<p>The finest parts of Nepal consist of two delightful vallies
separated from each other by the mountain Chandangiri; but these
vallies, called Great and Little Nepal, do not include the whole
of Nepala Desa, which is one of the fifty-six regions of Hindu
geography.&nbsp; It extends also a considerable way over the
countries watered by streams which run from the outside of the
mountains that inclose the greater valley, and which fall into
the Gandaki on the west, and the Kausiki on the east.&nbsp; The
real boundaries are four celebrated places of pilgrimage;
Nilkantha, eight days&rsquo; journey north from Kathmandu;
Nateswar, three days&rsquo; journey south; Kaleswar, two
days&rsquo; journey west; and Bhimeswar, four days&rsquo; journey
east.&nbsp; The whole territory between these places is holy
ground, and is properly called Dhama.&nbsp; This holy land,
according to the Brahmans, is inhabited by 5,600,000 Bhairawas
and Bhairawis.&nbsp; The former are male spirits of Maha Deva, or
Siva, and the latter are female spirits of the Sakti, who is the
wife, the mother, and the divine power of that deity.&nbsp; The
whole territory within these boundaries was not, however, subject
to the Newan chiefs who governed Nepal, and a large part in the
vicinity of Nilkantha in particular, until the rise of the house
of Gorkha, was subject to Thibet.</p>
<p>Nilkantha is a place much frequented by pilgrims, and which
<!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>would seem to possess many natural curiosities.&nbsp; I
therefore shall here annex an account of the best route to it, in
hopes that it may be of use to some fortunate traveller, who may
procure access to visit the Alps of Nepal.&nbsp; The traveller
ought to proceed to Yogimara, the route to which I have mentioned
before.</p>
<p>From Yogimara it is one day&rsquo;s journey north and east to
Mahes Domohana, a large village on a hill, at the junction of the
Mahes with the Trisulgangga.&nbsp; The Mahes rises at
Bhenjhongga, a village three coses west from Kirtipur, in the
greater valley of Nepal.</p>
<p>From Mahes Domohana to Devighat is a distance of 2&frac12;
days&rsquo; journey, with not above two or three villages on the
whole route.&nbsp; Devighat is a large village, where the Tazi or
Tadi joins the Trisulgangga, and where there are annually several
assemblies for the people to bathe at the junction of the
streams.&nbsp; Kanak Nidhi, it must be observed, places a
Devighat much lower down, at the junction of the Trisulgangga
with the Gandi, but the Devi Ghat at the junction of the Tadi and
Trisulgangga, or Daiby Ghaut, as he calls it, is that described
by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation193"></a><a
href="#footnote193" class="citation">[193]</a> at considerable
length.&nbsp; It is dedicated to Maha Maia, or Bhawani,
concerning whom, Colonel Kirkpatrick, or his editor, seems to
have fallen into several errors, saying, &ldquo;that Bhowani is
Daiby, (so he writes the words,) in her character of universal
mother, or in other words Nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Devi and
Bhawani have exactly the same meaning, that is, the Goddess; and
Maha Maia is not universal mother, but great mother; nor is
Bhawani ever worshipped as the Genetrix natur&aelig;, as
universal mother might imply, but as the Sakti, or power of Siva,
who <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>is the God of destruction, and her
worship is entirely that of fear.</p>
<p>North from this Devighat, six hours&rsquo; (two pahars)
journey, is Nayakot, a town of Nepal Proper, situated on a hill,
on the east side of the Trisulgangga.&nbsp; It contains about
12,000 houses, mostly occupied by Newars, and is built of brick
like Kathmandu.&nbsp; The Court often retires here in the winter,
the situation being warmer than Kathmandu.&nbsp; The town is
situated on a hill, overhanging a valley, which Colonel
Kirkpatrick <a name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194]</a> estimates to be 2200 feet lower than
Kathmandu, on which account, it is not habitable after the middle
of April, being subject to the Ayul.</p>
<p>From Nayakot north, one day&rsquo;s journey, is Dhayabung, a
village chiefly inhabited by Bhotiyas, and situated on a high
hill at the Bitrawati ghat.&nbsp; The Bitrawati comes from the
east, and has a course of four or five hours&rsquo; (1&frac12;
pahar) journey in length.</p>
<p>North from Dhayabung, one day&rsquo;s journey, is Dhunchi, a
Bhotiya village, on a large hill, south from the
Trisulgangga.</p>
<p>From Dhunchi east, one day&rsquo;s journey, is Dhimsa, a large
Bhotiya village, not now subject to Gorkha.&nbsp; From Dhimsa to
Gosaingsthan there are no inhabitants, and the country is covered
with snow.&nbsp; Three hours&rsquo; journey from Dhimsa, the
pilgrims come to Ganes Gongera, where there is an image of Ganes,
to which the pilgrims resort.&nbsp; They then proceed about seven
or eight hours&rsquo; journey (two or three pahars) to Bara
Nilkantha, where, during the fair, there are many shops.&nbsp;
There are eight springs, one of which is hot, and emits a blue
flame from its surface.&nbsp; East from thence one-half cose, is
a pool called Gaurikunda.&nbsp; Another pool, named Suryakunda,
is about one-half cose farther east; and immediately beyond that,
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>rises the immense peak of Gosaingsthan, from the
east-side of which a branch of the Kausiki issues.&nbsp; On a
mountain south from Gosaingsthan, and called Mahamandal, are
found lead, zinc, or tutenague, mica in large plates, and rock
crystal.</p>
<p>From Dhunchi there is a road to Kerung, one day&rsquo;s
journey north.&nbsp; This has lately been ceded to the Chinese by
the governors of Nepal.</p>
<p>Considerable illustrations of this route up the Trisulgangga,
by Nayakot to Nilkantha, and Kerung, <a name="citation195"></a><a
href="#footnote195" class="citation">[195]</a> may be found in
the 5th Chapter of Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Account of Nepaul, page
107, etc.</p>
<p>I have already given an account of the Newars, and of the
mineral productions of the valley of Nepal, and now proceed to
treat of some other circumstances, relating partly to the former,
and partly to the present state of things, when Nepal has become
the seat of a foreign government; although by this arrangement, I
must here detail much of what I have to state concerning the
family which now reigns, and to which I must afterwards
return.</p>
<p>The following is the route to Kathmandu, by which I went to
that city, and which is the one most frequented by merchants from
the low country, especially by those trading to Patna, which is
the principal mart for this commerce.</p>
<p>From the Company&rsquo;s boundary near the Bera river are
about ten miles to Gar Pasara, over an open plain, little of
which is cultivated.&nbsp; An old fort, and many plantations of
Mango trees, show that formerly it has been in a better
state.&nbsp; We crossed the Bera, and passed some way along the
banks of another river.&nbsp; Even in the end of March, these
rivers are full of water, and contain no large banks of sand, as
is usual in India.&nbsp; With industry, they might be applied
most advantageously to irrigate <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the
fields.&nbsp; The water is dirty, and owing to the quantity of
rotten vegetable matter which it brings from the forest, and
which at this season is little diluted, it is reckoned very
unwholesome.&nbsp; Gar Pasara is a small village with a large
tank.&nbsp; Near it is a brick house built by Singha Pratap, the
present Raja of Gorkha&rsquo;s grandfather, who in the cold
season sometimes resided in the Tariyani, on the improvement of
which he bestowed considerable attention.</p>
<p>From Gar Pasara to Bichhakor is about fourteen miles.&nbsp;
The three first miles are clear, the remainder passes through a
stately forest, with little or no underwood, but some long grass
and reeds.&nbsp; For seven miles the ground in the forest is
nearly level, and a very little trouble would make the road fit
for carts.&nbsp; The remaining road passes along the lower part
of some small hills, which are rather stony, and it crosses the
rough and wide channels of some torrents, which in the cold
season are perfectly dry; yet a small labour would render the
whole way from Gar Pasara to Bichhakor passable for carts.&nbsp;
At present it is perfectly good for laden cattle.&nbsp; There is
no water by the way.&nbsp; Bichhakor contains about a dozen huts,
and affords no supplies except wood and water, of which last
there is a very fine spring, and several small streams in a very
wide stony channel, the only clear place in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Bichhakor derives its name from the place abounding in
scorpions.&nbsp; There is no cultivation near it, and the only
inhabitants are a few Parbatiyas, or mountain Hindus.&nbsp; They
reside at the place to collect some duties, and for the
accommodation of travellers, and by long habit have become inured
to the climate, and enabled to resist its baneful influence,
which, from the end of March, till the beginning of December, is
exceedingly destructive to all strangers.&nbsp; The temperature
of the air at Bichhakor is sensibly cooler than at Gar Pasara,
and <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>we found the heat of the spring to
be 74&deg; Fahrenheit&rsquo;s thermometer, which may be
considered as the average heat of the place.</p>
<p>From Bichhakor to Hethaura is about sixteen miles.&nbsp; For
the first seven miles the channel serves as a road; but both
sides consist of low steep hills and precipices; the former
covered with thick woods, among which are many pines.&nbsp; The
ascent on the whole is considerable, but is nowhere steep; and
with a little pains, the road might be made very good for loaded
oxen, or even for light carriages.&nbsp; Even now, cattle convey
along it on their backs the usual burthen of grain.&nbsp; About
seven miles from Bichhakor, the road proceeds to the right from
the channel, through a very strong pass called Chiriyaghat, or
bird passage.&nbsp; It is commanded by two hills, which are less
than a mile from the river, and which, although steep, are not
high.&nbsp; The road between them is narrow, but in other
respects is not bad.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a> considers Chiriyaghat as the name of
the whole ridge, and not as that of the pass, as the name would
seem to imply, and as I understood.&nbsp; From Chiriyaghat to
Hethaura, the road is very good for loaded cattle, and might be
easily rendered fit for carts.&nbsp; It descends gently through a
country that rises into small swells, and has few trees, but is
intersected by several dry water courses.&nbsp; About a mile from
Hethaura, the Karara, coming from the east, passes the
road.&nbsp; The ford is perfectly easy, and the road from thence
to Hethaura is good, leading through a stately forest.&nbsp; From
Chiriyaghat to Hethaura, there is no water except the Karara, a
dirty black stream, which it is unsafe to drink, being black and
unwholesome.</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>The route to Hethaura above described by Gar Pasara, or
as he writes it Goolpussra, <a name="citation198a"></a><a
href="#footnote198a" class="citation">[198a]</a> or Goorpussra,
<a name="citation198b"></a><a href="#footnote198b"
class="citation">[198b]</a> according to Colonel Kirkpatrick,
possesses decided advantages over that by the Bhareh pass,
situated farther east.</p>
<p>Hethaura stands on a fine plain, about a mile wide, which is
bounded on the north by the Raputi, and on the south by the
Karara.&nbsp; The soil of this plain is good, but none of it is
cultivated, and most of it is covered with stately forests of the
Sakhuya or Sal, which are kept clear of underwood, by burning at
this season the fallen leaves and dry grass.&nbsp; This is done
to all the forests in the neighbourhood, and every night of my
stay, the surrounding hills were illuminated in a very grand
manner.</p>
<p>The Raputi is a beautiful rapid clear stream, which, having
come from the north, turns here to the west, and after having
been joined by the Karara some way below, passes till it joins
the Gandaki, through a valley, the lower part of which is
cultivated, but all near Hethaura is waste, although the plain
there would admit of a considerable extent of cultivation, should
ever the jealousy of the Nepal government be so far removed as to
allow the forests to be cleared.&nbsp; This, however, is not
likely soon to be the case, as these forests increase the
insalubrity of the air at Hethaura, which is one of the most
important stations that could be chosen by invaders coming from
the south.&nbsp; All kind of stores and provisions can be
transported to it with ease, and it is a fine situation,
admitting of a large camp.&nbsp; This might be secured by taking
Makwanpur, a fortress situated about five miles to the eastward
on a high hill.&nbsp; The people of Nepal are very jealous
concerning Makwanpur, <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Hariharpur, and Sinduli, as the
possession of these would give an enemy the entire command of the
Tariyani.</p>
<p>The heat at Hethaura is much more temperate than that of the
Tariyani; but, as the warm season advances, the air becomes
exceedingly unhealthy, which seems to be chiefly owing to the
want of cultivation.</p>
<p>For the accommodation of merchants, Hethaura has a brick
building, which surrounds a square court.&nbsp; There are also a
few shops.</p>
<p>From Hethaura to Bhimphedi is a distance of about eighteen
miles, leading through a narrow defile, between high and steep
hills, overgrown with thick woods.&nbsp; The Raputi winds through
the defile in an extraordinary manner, so that it is crossed
twenty-two times by the way.&nbsp; It is a strong, rapid, clear
stream, not too deep to prevent it from being easily forded, so
far as the water is concerned; but the channel is filled with
rounded slippery stones, that render the fords very bad; when we
went, bridges had therefore been constructed of trees laid from
stone to stone, and covered with earth, so that cattle might have
passed with tolerable ease, nor is the road very bad.&nbsp; From
Hethaura to Bhimphedi is usually reckoned one day&rsquo;s
journey; but in returning, I halted by the way, on a clear space,
called Maka Paka, which, although of small extent, and uneven,
afforded abundance of wood and water; while at Bhimphedi the
supply of the latter is scanty, and it is practicable from Maka
Paka to go over the hill of Chisapani, and in one day to reach
the fine rivulet called Panauni, which is on its north
side.&nbsp; Between Maka Paka and Hethaura are a few cleared
spots, like it cultivated by rude tribes, who shun all
communication with travellers, and dwell in the recesses of
forests which protect them from the Gorkhalese.</p>
<p>About fourteen miles from Hethaura, and a little way from <!--
page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>Maka Paka, the road leaves the immediate bank of the
Raputi, and ascends a very steep and strong bank, called
Dokaphedi, from whence to Bhimphedi there is a fine level.</p>
<p>At Bhimphedi, the valley of the Raputi entirely ceases, and
the high mountains called Lama Dangra divide it from the country
on the north watered by the branches of the Vagmati.&nbsp; A
large channel, one of the branches of the Raputi, passes
Bhimphedi; but in the dry season it contains no water, and the
inhabitants receive a scanty supply from a small spring.&nbsp;
Water, however, might probably be procured in abundance, by
digging wells in the channel of the torrent.</p>
<p>The height of Bhimphedi, above Hethaura, is very considerable,
and the influence of the Ayul is much later in extending there,
owing to the coolness of the air.&nbsp; At sunrise, on the 8th
April, while the thermometer in the air was at 67&deg; of
Fahrenheit&rsquo;s scale, it sunk to 63&deg; upon being immersed
into the spring.&nbsp; This may be considered as the average heat
of the place, which is about 27&deg; 30&prime; of north
latitude.&nbsp; Here the mercury in our barometer sunk out of
sight below the scale, which descended only to twenty-six inches;
nor during our stay in Nepal did the mercury ever reach that
height.&nbsp; At Bhimphedi, the vegetable productions put on a
strong resemblance to those of Europe.&nbsp; It is a small
village inhabited by Parbatiyas, and where some public buildings
have been erected for the accommodation of passengers.&nbsp; Some
shops afford grain, and such articles of consumption as Hindu
travellers usually require.</p>
<p>From Bhimphedi to the copper mine (Tamrakhani) on the Panauni,
is about 5&frac12; miles over the chain of mountains called
Lamadangra, and by the pass called Chisapani.&nbsp; The mountain
is of great elevation, and very steep, but not very rugged; nor
are the woods thick, although the trees are lofty.&nbsp; Except
in steepness, the road is not bad.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>About a mile and a half from Bhimphedi, I came to a
fort called Chisapani, considered as the bulwark of Nepal; but it
is by no means fitted to inspire us with respect for the skill of
the engineers of Gorkha.&nbsp; It is situated on the declivity of
the hill, so that an assailant might go round by the right, and
when he had got above it, even with musquetry, the garrison could
not show their faces on the works.&nbsp; Its form will be
understood from the sketch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p201.jpg">
<img alt=
"Chisapani Fort"
title=
"Chisapani Fort"
src="images/p201.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The center in which the gates are is commanded by the two
wings.&nbsp; The whole is built of brick, without any
ditch.&nbsp; The wall on the upper side is about thirteen feet
high; but on the lower front, the height of the parapet being
carried round on a level, the elevation may be eighteen
feet.&nbsp; This fort is always guarded by a company of seapoys;
and, if fully garrisoned, might contain two hundred men.&nbsp;
Round the fort a space has been cleared from trees; but so steep
is the hill, that an enemy resting at the edge of the forest, and
within two hundred yards of the fort, is not from thence
visible.&nbsp; Immediately above the fort is a small village and
market, (bazar;) but the Hindu engineers have been so
improvident, that the only supply of water is about half a mile
higher up the mountain.&nbsp; There, near the road, is a small
spring of fine clear water, like that at Bhimphedi.&nbsp; It is
called Chisa Pani, or the cold water, <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>and is
reckoned unwholesome, probably from people having suffered by
drinking it rashly, when they have been heated by ascending the
hill: for being a pure spring, it is probably excellent
water.</p>
<p>For about a mile beyond the spring, the road continues to
ascend, although with a more moderate declivity than below the
fort.&nbsp; At the summit of the hill are some old
fortifications, which were said to form the boundary between
Nepal Proper and Makwanpur.&nbsp; The view from thence is said to
be very grand, but a thick haze in all directions hindered me
from seeing any thing except the neighbouring hills.</p>
<p>From this summit to the Panauni river, there is a very steep
descent of about two miles through a beautiful forest of oaks,
which is clear from underwood, and ornamented with the purple
flowers of a large rhododendron, and with innumerable parasitical
plants, having splendid and odorous flowers.&nbsp; In this
forest, on account of its northern exposure, the pine does not
thrive.&nbsp; The road over this mountain called Chisapani, is on
the whole fatiguing; nor will it admit of any load being
transported by cattle.&nbsp; To conduct a road over such a
mountain, with proper slopes, so as to enable carriages to pass,
is a work not to be expected from the natives, who, even if they
were able to contrive such a work, would be afraid to put it in
execution; as they would consider it as likely to afford too free
an intercourse with their more powerful neighbours; and jealousy
of strangers is the predominant principle in the Nepal
government.</p>
<p>The Panauni is a clear rapid stream, with various branches,
which come from the west and north, and water the country called
Lahuri, or Little Nepal.&nbsp; All these branches unite where the
road descends from Chisapani, and run to the east to join the
Vagmati.&nbsp; Having crossed the Panauni twice, and <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>observed in its channel numerous large masses of grey
granite, I halted to breakfast at a small village named Tamra
Khani.&nbsp; Near it is a productive copper mine, which the
jealousy of the people hindered me from seeing, nor could I
procure any of the ore, except a few small fragments.&nbsp; Tamra
Khani, or the copper mine, is a small village inhabited by
mountain Hindus, (Parbatiyas,) and situated in a very narrow part
of the valley, which is straitened by an insulated hill on the
north side of the river.&nbsp; Although its situation is low, yet
being subject to continual high winds, this place is by the
natives considered as very cold.</p>
<p>From thence I proceeded about six miles, and having at first
followed the principal stream of the Panauni, and then one of its
branches, I halted a little beyond Chitlong, after having had a
good view of Lahuri Nepal.&nbsp; Except in dimensions, this so
much resembles the larger valley, that I need not take up much
time in its description.&nbsp; The road through it frequently
crosses the river, and ascends a steep hill above a village named
Marku; but this might be in a great measure avoided.&nbsp; The
whole valley is not only clear of woods, but very bare.&nbsp; Its
surface is extremely uneven, but is finely watered by numerous
springs and rivulets, so that it is well cultivated, and produces
much grain.&nbsp; The whole appearance of Lahuri Nepal, and its
vegetable productions, strongly resemble those of the wilder
parts of Britain; and, during my stay, I was entertained with the
note of an old acquaintance, the cuckoo.&nbsp; The air of the
higher part of the valley where we encamped is much cooler than
that of Kathmandu, and was so sharp to our relaxed habits, that
our winter clothing became comfortable, although Chitlong is
situated nearly in twenty-seven degrees and a half of north
latitude.&nbsp; I judge from the temperature of the springs, as
they issue from the earth, that its mean <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>heat is
58&frac12; degrees of Fahrenheit&rsquo;s scale.&nbsp; The
winters, however, are never severe; and at that season the fields
produce a crop of wheat, while in summer they yield one of
rice.&nbsp; The great inferiority of this country, when compared
with the mountains of Europe, consists in its pasture, which is
very poor.&nbsp; It is, however, of a more nourishing quality
than the rank grass of the Tariyani; for the cattle of Chitlong
are in excellent condition when compared with those below the
mountains.</p>
<p>Lahuri Nepal formerly belonged to the Raja of Lalita
Patan.&nbsp; Its chief town called Chitlong, is well built, and
its inhabitants are mostly Newars.</p>
<p>From Chitlong is about four miles to Thankot in the greater
valley of Nepal.&nbsp; The road is very bad and rough, and
conducts through forests over a mountain named Chandangiri, and
nearly as difficult of ascent and descent as Chisapani.&nbsp; It
derives its name, signifying sandal mountain, from one of the
fables in the Hindu mythology, which states, that the goddess
Parwati, the wife of Siva, rubbed herself with the powder of this
fragrant wood while she sat on the mountain.&nbsp; Colonel
Kirkpatrick calls this Chandraghiri, or the Mountain of the Moon.
<a name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a>&nbsp; On the highest part of the pass
a house has been built for the accommodation of passengers.&nbsp;
In the wooden carved work of this building are some very indecent
figures, which by the natives are considered as fit ornaments,
even in places erected from religious motives, as all these
houses for the accommodation of travellers are.</p>
<p>Thankot is a small town, finely supplied with wood and
water.&nbsp; It stands on a rocky eminence at the south west
corner of the valley of Nepal, in a district separated from the
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>other parts of the plain by a low ridge of hills.&nbsp;
On the most conspicuous part of this ridge stands Kirtipur, a
considerable town.&nbsp; This part of the valley seems to be a
good deal elevated above the portion which contains Kathmandu;
and I found the heat of a spring in a small wood above Thankot to
be 59&frac12; degrees of Fahrenheit&rsquo;s thermometer.&nbsp;
From Thankot to Kathmandu is about seven miles over very uneven
cultivated fields, with no roads but foot-paths.</p>
<p>The larger valley of Nepal is somewhat of a circular form, and
is watered by numerous branches of the Vagmati, which flow from
the surrounding hills towards the centre, and unite into one
stream a little way south from the capital.&nbsp; From the place
of junction the Vagmati runs south, and goes to the Tariyani,
after having forced a passage through the mountains.&nbsp; Taken
in the largest sense, therefore, the valley of Nepal comprehends
all the grounds watered by these branches of the Vagmati, and,
according to this definition, it is about twenty-two miles from
east to west, and twenty miles from north to south.&nbsp; This
extent is every where bounded by a chain of hills, all of which
are steep, and some of them rise into high mountains.&nbsp; Of
these the most remarkable are Shiva, or Siwapuri, on the north,
Nagarjun on the west, Chandangiri on the south-west, Pulihu on
the south east, and Devikot on the east.&nbsp; It must be
observed, that from these hills, various branches reach a
considerable way into the plain, and separate from it small
vallies, most of which are considerably elevated above the
general level, and from these vallies issue the various streams
by which the country is irrigated.&nbsp; The larger valley,
reduced by these branches, may be about fourteen miles each
way.&nbsp; A person placed in the centre of this extent would
consider the whole as one great level, but on travelling about,
he frequently comes to very deep hollows, <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>excavated
by the various branches of the river, which flow with a very
gentle current in large sandy channels.&nbsp; Except after heavy
rains, these are almost always fordable, and are commonly sunk
fifty or sixty feet perpendicular below the general level of the
plain.</p>
<p>It appears evident to me, that Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a> judged rightly in supposing that this
valley has formerly been a lake, which has gradually deposited
all the alluvial matter that now forms the different substrata of
the plain.&nbsp; The extent of the lake may in all places be
traced by that of the alluvial matters, above the edges of which
generally appear irregularly shaped large stones, which, having
rolled down from the hills, stopped at the water&rsquo;s edge as
usual in the lakes of hilly countries.&nbsp; The memory of the
lake is preserved in the fables contained in the books of the
natives, which mention the deity by whom the mountain was cleft
to drain off the water, together with numerous circumstances
connected with this event.&nbsp; The following is an account of
these fables that was communicated to me by Colonel
Crawford.&nbsp; When the valley of Nepal was an immense lake, an
incarnation of Buddha was born in that country.&nbsp; A petition
was therefore made to the gods requesting that the lake might be
drained, that the valley might be filled with inhabitants, and
that thus the number of the followers of Buddha might
increase.&nbsp; The gods attended to this petition, and ordered
Menjoo Dev&rsquo; to evacuate the waters by making a cut through
the mountains.&nbsp; This he performed with one blow of his
scimitar, and ever since, the waters of the Vagmati have flowed
through the gap, which he then formed.&nbsp; The spirit who had
presided over the lake was a large serpent, who, finding his
water become scanty, and the dry land <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>beginning
every where to appear, became exceedingly wroth, but he was
pacified by the gods, who formed for his residence a miraculous
tank, which is situated a little to the southward of Lalita
Patan.&nbsp; This tank has a number of angles, all of which
cannot be seen at once from any station; they can only,
therefore, be numbered by walking round the tank; the miraculous
nature of which, in the opinion of the natives, is fully
demonstrated by no two persons who make the attempt to number
these angles, being able to agree concerning this important
point.</p>
<p>The Brahmans, it must be observed, have invented another
story, equally extravagant, and attribute the blow which cleared
the valley to Anirudha, the grandson of Krishna, who at the same
time killed Sangkhasur, who until then had been lord of
Nepal.</p>
<p>The Vagmati must always have flowed from the valley, to carry
away the vast body of water collected in the rainy season, and
which evidently was confined by a narrow ledge of rocks, which
crosses the channel of the river, where it enters the southern
mountainous district.&nbsp; At that time the bottom of the lake
must have been a smooth cavity, and it must have been surrounded
by small narrow glens, pouring their streams into the lake, as
they now do into the valley.&nbsp; As the river gradually wore
away the rock, over which it must have been precipitated in a
cataract, the water in the lake would subside, and the various
streams running from the glens would form deep excavations in the
soft matter that had formerly been deposited by the water; and
this operation would go on, till the ledge of rock was entirely
worn away, and a stop was put to the sinking of the river, by the
immerse mass of rock opposed to its influence.</p>
<p>While the lake existed, there must have appeared in it two
<!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>islands, which now form hills.&nbsp; The one is called
Sambhunath, or rather Swayambhunath, as being, in the opinion of
the Bouddhists of Nepal and Thibet, a favourite residence of the
Supreme Being.&nbsp; It is an elegant hill, with two peaks
occupied by religious buildings, and covered with the most
stately trees.&nbsp; It is a conspicuous object from almost every
part of the valley, and every where appears to great
advantage.</p>
<p>The description given of the Temple of Buddha on this hill by
Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a> is not very
accurate, and the drawing is bad, especially in representing the
upper part quadrangular, while in reality it is round.&nbsp; It
is generally admitted to be the most ancient temple or edifice in
Nepal, and, indeed, Colonel Kirkpatrick states, that it was built
by Maun Deo, (Mana Deva,) who, according to him, was the
sixty-first prince of the country, before the year of Christ
1323.&nbsp; Allowing ten years for each reign, this would place
the building of the temple in the beginning of the eighth
century, which, from its appearance, is fully as early a date as
can be admitted.</p>
<p>The other hill is larger, but not so high, and is greatly
celebrated among the followers of the Vedas.&nbsp; It is
venerated as being the residence of Siva, under the name of
Pasupatinath, and of his wife, under the name of
Guhyiswari.&nbsp; The hill is covered with trees, and has a
temple dedicated to each of the deities.&nbsp; These temples are
frequented by great numbers of pilgrims, who, by visiting the
holy place, expect to be ever afterwards secured from being born
an animal lower than man.&nbsp; The hill, in a large part of its
circumference, is washed by the Vagmati, which is there a holy
river; and all the Hindus of Nepal wish to expire with their feet
immersed in its stream, <!-- page 209--><a

desirous, that after death they should be burned on its
banks.</p>

<p>The two copperplate engravings, taken from drawings by Colonel
Crawford, will give an idea of the scenery in the valley of
Nepal.&nbsp; No. 1. represents the temple of Bouddhama in
Kasacheit, the most favourite place of worship with the Khat
Bhotiyas, or ancient inhabitants of the country.&nbsp; In the
distant parts of the back ground are peaks of the Himaliya
mountains rising through the clouds.&nbsp; No. 2 gives a distant
view of Kathmandu towards the right, and Lalita Patan towards the
left, with the temple of Jagannath between them, and in front of
Lalita Patan, the Queen&rsquo;s Garden, in which the British
Embassy was lodged.&nbsp; The town of Kirtipur is seen on a hill
behind Kathmandu.</p>
<p>In Nepal Proper, the Parbatiyas are not near so numerous as
the Newars.&nbsp; The valley of Nepal seems to be exceedingly
populous; but when the natives, as usual, talk of 18,000 houses
in Kathmandu, 24,000 in Lalita Patan, and 12,000 in Bhatgang,
they certainly grossly exaggerate.&nbsp; The persons of all ages
and both sexes may in these towns amount to such numbers, and in
Kathmandu may perhaps somewhat exceed this calculation.&nbsp;
There are, besides, in this small valley several other
considerable towns, such as Timmi, Kirtipur, Dewapatan, Sangghu,
and Thankot.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick observes, <a name="citation209"></a><a
href="#footnote209" class="citation">[209]</a> that &ldquo;we are
altogether unfurnished with any documents that would warrant our
hazarding even a conjecture on the number of people, the
materials we possess for judging of the population of the valley
of Nepaul itself being at the best extremely vague, and enabling
us only to state it loosely at about half a million.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In p. 161, <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>he reckons 48,000 or 50,000 people
in Kathmandu, which seems to me considerably exaggerated.</p>
<p>The Parbatiyas do not, like the Newars, delight in towns and
villages, and, except the followers of the court, few reside in
Kathmandu, or other cities of Nepal; neither are they so much
addicted to large brick buildings; for the princes of the Gorkha
family, although they have united very extensive dominions under
their authority, have been contented with the palace of the petty
chief of Kathmandu, or Kathmaro, as it is often called.&nbsp;
This, indeed, is a large building, but of so singular a form,
that our terms of art could not be applied to describe its
architecture.&nbsp; It possesses no magnificence, and seems to
have been inferior to the palaces of Lalita Patan and
Bhatgang.&nbsp; All the three, however, are works of astonishing
magnitude, considering the small extent of country subject to the
princes by whom they were built.&nbsp; The great families of
Gorkha have occupied the best houses of the Newars, or have built
others in the same style, some of which are mansions that in
appearance are befitting men of rank.&nbsp; The greater part of
the Parbatiyas, however, retain their old manners, and each man
lives on his own farm.&nbsp; Their huts are built of mud, and are
either white-washed or painted red with a coloured clay.&nbsp;
They are covered with thatch, and, although much smaller than the
houses of the Newars, seem more comfortable, from their being
much more neat and clean.&nbsp; Their usual form may be seen in
the foreground of the copperplate No. 1.</p>
<p>Near the palace of Kathmandu is the shrine of Tulasi Bhawani,
(Toolaja Bhowani, <a name="citation210"></a><a
href="#footnote210" class="citation">[210]</a>) who, with
Gorakhanath, is the tutelar deity of the reigning family.&nbsp;
There is no image of this <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>deity which
is represented by a Yantra, or cabalistical figure.&nbsp; In
order to impress the subjects with awe, no person is admitted
into this shrine except the Raja, the Rani or Queen, the Guru or
spiritual guide of the prince, and the Pujari or priest, who is
always of the Guru&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; In order probably to add
more to the awe of the place, Prithwi Narayan is said to have
offered some human sacrifices; but the deity is reported to have
reprimanded the prince in a dream, and ever since the victims
offered have been buffaloes, sheep, and goats.&nbsp; After the
proper ceremonies have been performed, the throat of the animal
is cut, in the outer part of the temple, before the multitude,
and the blood is carried into the shrine by the priest, or by the
prince.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation211"></a><a
href="#footnote211" class="citation">[211]</a> describes the
twenty most remarkable temples of Nepal, excluding the two
greatest, Sambhunat and Bouddhama, as being heterodox; but he was
not aware, that the same reason should have induced him to
exclude the temples of Matsyendranath, (Mutchendernath,) and
Gorakhnath, (Goorukhnath.)&nbsp; I may, however, refer to his
account for all that requires to be mentioned on this
subject.</p>
<p>Nepal Proper is immediately under the management of the
Bahradar, or great officers of the court.&nbsp; Kathmandu, for
the support of the court, pays annually 18,000 rupees, Lalita
Patan pays 18,000, Bhatgang 14,000, and Kirtipur 7000.</p>
<p>About three years ago, a kind of perpetual settlement was made
on these crown lands.&nbsp; Each farm was assessed at a certain
quantity of grain, which the farmer might either pay in kind, or
in money, at the market price.&nbsp; Much benefit would have
resulted to the Company, had Lord Cornwallis adopted such a
plan.&nbsp; A very large portion of Nepal Proper has been <!--
page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>alienated, either in fee or in charity lands.&nbsp; A
fine town, named Sangghu, is the Jaygir, or jointure lands of the
Maha Rani, or Queen Regent, and is worth annually 4000
rupees.&nbsp; Dewa Patan, a still larger place, belongs entirely
to the temples of Pasupatinath and Guhyiswari.</p>
<p>The trade of Nepal was formerly pretty considerable, although
the territories of the Raja produce few articles for exportation,
except iron, copper, and drugs.&nbsp; At present the defects in
the police, and the total want of credit, partly owing to the
weakness of the law, and partly to the falsehood of the people,
have in a great measure put a stop to the commerce which passed
through the country.&nbsp; Its nature was as follows:</p>
<p>Some merchants of Kasmir carried their manufactures by the way
of Ladak to Kutti, and other towns in Thibet, in order to procure
the wool produced in these countries by the Shawl goat.&nbsp;
These manufactures were partly used in Thibet, partly sent to
Siling or Sining, on the western frontier of China, by the way of
Degarchi and Lassa, and partly sent to Patna by the way of
Kathmandu.&nbsp; These Kasmirians have factories at Lassa,
Siling, Patna, and Kathmandu.&nbsp; They brought from China such
goods as answered for the demand of Nepal and Kasmir, among which
tea and silks were the principal articles; and from Patna they
carried to China otters&rsquo; skins, to the annual amount of
about 50,000 rupees.&nbsp; These otters&rsquo; skins are procured
in the neighbourhood of Dhaka in Bengal.</p>
<p>Again the merchants of Bhot or Thibet brought for sale to
Kathmandu paper, coarse woollen cloths, horses, Shawl goats,
common goats, sheep, Chaury cattle, chauries, (changwari or
chaungri,) musk, salt, sal ammoniac, hurtal or yellow arsenic,
borax, quicksilver from China, gold-dust, silver, preserved
fruits, such as almonds, walnuts, raisins, and dates, and drugs,
such <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>as Indian madder or manjit, chirata,
and charas, or extract of hemp.&nbsp; Formerly the Lamas of
Degarchi (Teeshoo) and Lassa sent much bullion to the mint at
Kathmandu, and made a very liberal allowance for having it
coined; but the rapacity of Rana Bahadur induced him to alloy the
money, which of course put an entire stop to this source of
wealth.&nbsp; Of these articles, the greater part of the musk,
chaungris, hurtal, borax, and bullion, are sent to Patna, or the
low country.&nbsp; From thence again are brought up buffaloes,
goats, broad-cloth, cutlery, glass ware, and other European
articles, Indian cotton cloths, mother of pearl, pearls, coral,
beads, spices, pepper, betel nut and leaf, camphor, tobacco, and
phagu, or the red powder thrown about by the Hindus at their
festival called Holi.&nbsp; Most of these articles, together with
many utensils of wrought copper, brass, bell-metal, and iron, are
sold to the merchants of Thibet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>The borax and salt are said to be brought from a lake,
which is situated nearly north from Kathmandu, about fifteen
days&rsquo; journey beyond the Brahmaputra.&nbsp; They are
conveyed to Nepal on the backs of a large kind of sheep, of which
many have four horns, and which seem to be the common beasts of
burthen in all the countries towards the sources of the Indus,
Ganges, and Brahmaputra.&nbsp; The annexed figure represents a
wether of this breed.&nbsp; Each wether, according to what I
heard, carries about eighty pounds weight; but Colonel
Kirkpatrick <a name="citation214a"></a><a href="#footnote214a"
class="citation">[214a]</a> states the load at forty-two pounds,
which is more probable.&nbsp; These sheep are about the size of
the larger breeds in England.</p>
<p>Captain Turner <a name="citation214b"></a><a
href="#footnote214b" class="citation">[214b]</a> describes a
sheep used in Thibet for carrying burdens, but that is probably
different from what I have mentioned, as he takes no notice of
the sheep of this breed having four horns, and states them to be
of a small size.&nbsp; Each carries only from twelve to twenty
pounds.</p>
<p>In Nepal accounts are kept thus: 4 Damas = 1 Paisah; 4 Paisahs
= 1 Ana; 8 Anas = 1 Mohur.&nbsp; The Ana is an imaginary
money.&nbsp; The coin called a Mohur varies in its rate of
exchange, but is commonly worth 34 Paisahs.&nbsp; The Paisah
always exchanges for 4 Damas.&nbsp; On Prithwi Narayan&rsquo;s
accession, he called in all the gold and silver money and
recoined it, so that I could procure no pieces of a more ancient
date than his reign.&nbsp; Ever since that period the value of
the coin has continued the same, and is as follows.</p>
<p>Gold coins are called ashruffies; but the full ashruffy is not
coined.&nbsp; The fractions in use are halfs, quarters, and
eighths.&nbsp; The half ashruffy is by the Court paid away at the
rate of 14 Mohurs; and at this value it is a legal tender of
payment <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>between man and man, unless silver
has been specially stipulated.&nbsp; In the market, however, the
half ashruffy usually exchanges for 12&frac12; Mohurs.&nbsp; It
weighs 84&frac14; grains; and, according to an assay made at
Calcutta, is worth nearly three Calcutta rupees, or nearly six
shillings and threepence at the mint price.</p>
<p>The coins analogous to the rupee of Hindustan and its
fractions are collectively called Madarmali.&nbsp; Colonel
Kirkpatrick writes this word <a name="citation215"></a><a
href="#footnote215" class="citation">[215]</a> Mehnder mulie,
applies it only to the Mohur or Mohr, as he calls it, and says
that the word is derived from the name of a prince.&nbsp; The
integer is called Pura Rupiya, or Du Mohur, and is seldom
seen.&nbsp; The half is called the Mohur, and is the common
silver currency in the country.&nbsp; When new it weighs
84&frac14; grains, and is worth six anas, 10&#8541; pies, or
43/100 of the Calcutta rupee.&nbsp; The quarter is called Adha
Mohur; the eighth is called Suki.</p>
<p>Besides the Madarmali, there is a wretched small silver coin
called Dama, of which the value in exchange is variable; but
commonly 136 Damas are given for one Mohur.</p>
<p>The copper coins are Paisas, Half-Paisas, and a few
Quarter-Paisas.&nbsp; These last are of the same value with the
Dama, but the minute silver coin is considered as more convenient
than the Paisa of copper.&nbsp; I am indeed persuaded that no
great inconvenience arises from a very minute coinage in
circulation; and that, without any loss, we might entirely
dispense with the use of a copper currency.</p>
<p>The weights in use are founded on the Paisa, but these are by
no means uniform.&nbsp; On an average, however, they may be taken
at 162 grains Troy weight.</p>
<p><!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>72 Paises = 1 Ser = lb. avoirdupois 1.666.</p>
<p>3 Sers = 1 Dharni = lb.&nbsp; 4.998.</p>
<p>The Dharni may therefore be considered as equal to five pounds
avoirdupois.&nbsp; It is also divided into two Bisulis, and four
Barapuls.</p>
<p>Grain is always sold by measure.</p>
<p>8 Manas = 1 Pathi = 152 cubical inches.</p>
<p>20 Pathis = 1 Muri = Winchester bushels 2-344/1000.</p>
<p>The whole lands in Nepal have long been divided into what are
called Khets or fields, each of which is estimated in ordinary
seasons to produce 100 Muris, or 234&frac12; bushels of Paddy, or
rice in the husk.&nbsp; About the year 1792 Ranjit Pangre, then
one of the Karyis, by the orders of Rana Bahadur, made a survey
of the valley; but the result has been kept secret.&nbsp; The
people know only that he estimated each of their possessions at a
certain number of Rupinis, and that on an average twenty-five of
these formed one Khet.&nbsp; They also observed, that in good
soils he used a rod seven cubits and a half in length, and in bad
soils he employed one nine cubits and a half long.&nbsp; Some
people who had resided at Patna informed my Brahman, that the
Rupini was nearly of the same size with the Biga of that city,
which is one-third of an English acre; and this is the only
foundation that I have for the calculations which I have
made.</p>
<p>It must, however, be observed, that, according to the
information received by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation216"></a><a href="#footnote216"
class="citation">[216]</a> the average Rupini contains only
3&frac34; Kathas of the Calcutta measure, or only 3/16 of what
was reported to me; and if his information is considered more
likely than mine to be correct, all the statements which <!--
page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>I have subsequently given, concerning the produce of an
acre in Nepal, must be augmented in that proportion.&nbsp; For
instance, I have stated the rice in the husk produced by an acre
to be about 28 bushels; but, according to the information given
to Colonel Kirkpatrick, it ought to be almost 150 bushels.&nbsp;
This induces me to place no great confidence in part of the
information given to the Colonel; for, as I shall afterwards have
occasion to state, I have no doubt that the crops of rice near
Calcutta are more abundant than those of Nepal.</p>
<p>In Nepal the pastures and forests are in general commons, and
any person that pleases may use them; but some forests are
reserved for the Court.&nbsp; Although these forests contain many
oak, chestnut, pine, and yew trees, none of these are by the
natives esteemed of much value; but for carpenter&rsquo;s work a
preference is given to the Champa or Michelia, which is certainly
a good kind of timber.</p>
<p>Nothing is paid for pasture; but, as it is very scarce, and as
the Newars do not employ cattle in agriculture, very few are bred
in the country.&nbsp; A few milch cows are kept in the towns, and
still more in the narrow vallies inhabited by Parbatiyas, who use
cattle in their ploughs.&nbsp; Buffaloes and goats are imported
from the low country; and horses, chaungri-cattle, shawl-goats,
common goats, and sheep, are brought from Bhot.&nbsp; They become
tolerably fat on the pasture of the hills, which, although
scanty, seems to be nourishing.&nbsp; Captain Knox killed two
female buffaloes, that had been fattened entirely on grass; and
they made tolerable beef.</p>
<p>No taxes are paid to government for houses.</p>
<p>The arable lands are partly retained as the immediate property
of the Court, for defraying the household expenses of the
Raja.&nbsp; The whole of the rice land near Nayakot is reserved
as the Raja&rsquo;s proper farm, and is cultivated by his
servants <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>and slaves, under the
superintendency of a steward: and the same management is observed
with a considerable number of fruit and flower gardens, in the
valley of Nepal, and with an extensive pasture on the banks of
the Kosi.&nbsp; The produce is not sold, but serves for the
consumption of the Court, and for distributing in charity at
temples, and to religious mendicants.&nbsp; By far the greater
part, however, of the lands reserved for the use of the Raja, is
let to tenants, as I have before mentioned.&nbsp; The extent of
these has at different times varied; but I believe they have
never produced a net income of more than a million of
mohurs.&nbsp; The only other public revenues are the fines levied
from offenders, which are sometimes considerable; the customs,
which are very trifling; and some small profits arising from the
mines, from elephants, and from the sale of Sal or Sakhuya
timber, from the forests below the mountains.&nbsp; The demands
on the treasury, however, are very few; for not only every
officer, civil and military, and every, soldier, but even the
private servants, and principal slaves of the Raja, are paid by
lands granted for their support.</p>
<p>The lands thus granted in fee for service are called Chakran,
and in general are resumable at pleasure, and follow the office
of the person by whom they are held; but some branches of the
Royal family, and some of the families of distinction, have
enjoyed certain lands ever since the time of Prithwi Narayan, and
it would not be safe to attempt a resumption of such
property.&nbsp; Some persons have even been permitted to alienate
such lands by sale; but to do so, the consent of the Court must
be obtained.&nbsp; I procured no information on which I could
attempt to calculate the amount of these two kinds of Chakran
lands.</p>
<p>Another kind of property, which pays no rent nor tax, and
which is not resumable, is called Khairat zemin, or Charity <!--
page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>land, which is the Birtha or Brhemoter land of Colonel
Kirkpatrick, (p. 92, 93.)&nbsp; This is of two kinds; part
belongs to Brahmans Bangras, or Achars; and another part has been
granted for the support of temples.&nbsp; The whole amount of
this kind of land is not equal to that reserved by the Crown for
its own purposes.</p>
<p>The Khairat that is given to religious men is of two
kinds.&nbsp; The first is called Yamapatri, which is given when
the Raja bestows Dhana in order to procure the remission of his
sins.&nbsp; This can never revert to the Crown, but, in case of
the family to which it was granted becoming extinct, it goes to
the temples of Pasupatinath and Changgu Narayan.&nbsp; The second
kind of Khairat given to religious men is bestowed on account of
their piety and learning; and, on failure of heirs, reverts to
the Crown.&nbsp; This kind may be sold, if the proprietor obtain
the consent of the Raja.</p>
<p>The lands belonging to the temples are in fact held by the
priests, (Pujaris,) who are bound to defray the expenses of
worship.&nbsp; They are removable at the pleasure of the
Raja.</p>
<p>This Khairat or Brhemoter land, Colonel Kirkpatrick says, is
also divided into two kinds, Koos Brhemoter and Soona Brhemoter,
the owners of which are perhaps the same with those called to me
Bitalpas and Brittiyas, mentioned in page 164, although this is
not very certain.&nbsp; The Koos Brhemoter land, according to the
Colonel, is rarely bestowed but on Brahmans, and that with a very
solemn investiture.&nbsp; Land of this kind is rent-free,
saleable, and hereditary, but for certain crimes it may be
forfeited.&nbsp; Presents are often given, especially on the
accession of a new Raja.&nbsp; The Soona Brhemoter has been
granted to certain Newars, and other natives of countries
subjected by the Gorkhalis, and continued by the conquerors <!--
page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>for a considerable fine under each succeeding prince,
but it is saleable and hereditary.</p>
<p>Landholders, who do not cultivate their own estates, in
general let them for one-half of the grain produced.&nbsp; Money
rent can seldom be procured, and is very low.&nbsp; It varies
from four to twelve anas a Rupini, which produces at least four
Muris of Paddy, one half of which, or the rent usual when paid in
kind, is worth about fifty anas, and if it be good land, it
produces also a winter crop.</p>
<p>Most great proprietors, however, like the Raja, employ
stewards with their servants and slaves, to cultivate some land
for supplying their families.&nbsp; The great, therefore, seldom
go to market, which, among a lawless people, is an advantage for
the lower classes, although it subjects travellers to great
inconveniency from the want of markets.&nbsp; It is besides
alleged, that the lower classes, in the vicinity of these farms,
often suffer by being compelled to labour without an adequate
remuneration.</p>
<p>When lands are alienated by sale, they bring from 1600 to 2000
Mohurs a Khet, which high price is owing to the very small
quantity of land that is brought to market.</p>
<p>The persons who rent lands from the owners are of two kinds:
first, the Kuriyas, who occupy free (Khairat) land, are exempted
from any services to government, except the repairing of roads,
and the attending on armies employed on certain duties; and,
secondly, the Prajas, who occupy the crown land, whether that be
held by the Prince, or granted in Jaygir.&nbsp; The Prajas are
bound to perform various services at the call, both of government
and of their immediate masters.&nbsp; The rent which both usually
pay is one-half of the produce, with an annual fine of between
two and three rupees for each Khet.&nbsp; Where the land is
tolerable, these terms are considered as <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>favourable
for the tenant, and enable him to support a family with ease.</p>
<p>The following is the account which my Brahman gives of the
agriculture of the Newars.</p>
<p>The hoe used by the Newars has been represented by Colonel
Kirkpatrick, (in the uppermost figure of the plate opposite to
page 100 of his Account of Nepaul,) but the figure is not
good.&nbsp; It seems a very awkward instrument, as the blade is
fixed by a long neck, so as to stand parallel to the short
handle, at about the distance or six inches.&nbsp; The labourer,
therefore, must either stoop exceedingly, when at work, or must
sit on his heels, which is the most usual posture.&nbsp; Still
these people use it with great dexterity, and one man in three
days digs up a Rupini.&nbsp; After each hoeing, the women and
children break the clods with a wooden mallet fixed to a long
shaft, which does not require them to stoop.&nbsp; Almost the
only other implement of agriculture these people have is the
Khuripi, or weeding iron, and some fans for winnowing the
corn.&nbsp; In Nepal, however, they have in some measure made a
further progress than in India, as they have numerous water-mills
for grinding corn.&nbsp; The stones are little larger than those
of hand-mills, and the upper one is turned round by being fixed
on the end of the axis of the water wheel, which is horizontal,
and is placed under the floor of the mill, with which the stones
are on a level.&nbsp; This wheel consists of six blades, about
three feet long, and six inches broad, which are placed obliquely
in the axle-tree.&nbsp; On these blades, the water falls down an
inclined plane of about eight or ten feet in perpendicular
height.&nbsp; The hopper is a basket perforated at the bottom,
but has no contrivance to shake it.&nbsp; The people at one of
the mills which we examined said, that, in one day, it could
grind twelve <i>Muris</i>, or rather more than twenty-nine
bushels.</p>
<p><!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>In Nepal, rice is the great crop, and the ground fit
for it is of two kinds, which differ in the manner, and in the
time of their cultivation, so as to make two harvests of rice:
but no one field, in one year, produces two crops of this
grain.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick indeed mentions, <a
name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a> that some fields yield two crops of
rice successively, the one coarse, and the other fine, besides
affording in the same year a crop of wheat.&nbsp; This, however,
I presume, does not allude to Nepal Proper, but to some of the
warmer vallies in the dominions of Gorkha; as where he goes on,
in the 99th page, to describe the expense of cultivation, he
mentions the ploughings, an operation which is not employed in
the agriculture of the Newars.</p>
<p>The first kind of ground produces the crop called Gheya, is
the highest, and there is no necessity for its being absolutely
level, as the fields are not inundated.&nbsp; From the 13th of
March to the 11th of April, this ground is hoed; and, having been
well manured with dung collected in the streets, it is hoed
again.&nbsp; A week after this, the field is hoed two or three
times, and is well pulverized with the mallet.&nbsp; About the
12th of May, after a shower of rain, the field is slightly hoed,
and the mould is broken, and smoothed with the hand.&nbsp; Small
drills, at a span&rsquo;s distance from each other, are then made
by the finger, which is directed straight by a line.&nbsp; At
every span-length in these drills are placed four or five seeds
of the rice, called Uya Dhan, which is the only kind cultivated
in this manner.&nbsp; The seed is covered by the hand, and a very
small quantity only is required.&nbsp; In about five days the
young corn comes up in small tufts, just as if it had been
transplanted.&nbsp; From the 13th of June to the 15th of August,
when the corn is about a cubit high, the weeds are removed with
the spud.&nbsp; About the <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>latter
period, slugs, worms, and insects, fill all the moister fields in
Nepal, and in order to be rid of them, the farmers keep a great
number of ducks, which, at this season, they turn into the
fields, to devour the vermin.&nbsp; The Gheya crop ripens about
the 1st of September, and by the middle of the month the harvest
is finished.&nbsp; The ears only are cut off, and next day the
grain is beat out, and generally dried in the streets.&nbsp; Very
little of the crop is made into Hakuya, a process that will be
afterwards mentioned.&nbsp; After the Gheya crop has been cut,
the field is in general cultivated with radishes, mustard, or
some other crop, that is usually sown about the time.</p>
<p>By far the greater part of the rice ground, and that the
lowest and the best, is of the kind which produces the crop of
rice called Puya.&nbsp; The kinds of rice which are cultivated in
this crop are very numerous, and it would be tedious to mention
their names, as I have no observations to make on any one in
particular.&nbsp; The fields which produce this crop must be
perfectly level, as they are inundated during the greater part of
the process of cultivation.&nbsp; Therefore, as the plain is by
no means even, it has been divided into terraces.&nbsp; So much
pains has been bestowed on this part of agriculture, that on the
steep descents leading down to the rivers, there have been formed
many terraces not above two feet wide.&nbsp; The numerous springs
and rivulets that issue from the surrounding hills have been
conducted with great pains to irrigate these terraces, and have
been managed with considerable skill.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the Puya crop commences between the 13th of
May and 12th of June, during which the field is hoed two or three
times, and manured with dung, if any can be procured.&nbsp; At
any rate, it is always manured with the kind of earth called
Koncha, which I have already described.&nbsp; The banks that
confine the water are then repaired; and about the <!-- page
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>12th of June, when, either by the rain or by the
irrigation from aqueducts, the fields have been inundated, and
the soil has been by the hoe reduced to mud, the seedlings which
have been raised in plots sown very thick, are transplanted by
the women.&nbsp; The men perform all the other parts of the
labour.&nbsp; This is a time of festivity as well as of hard
work; and the people are then allowed a great freedom of speech,
to which they are encouraged by large quantities of intoxicating
liquors, in a share of which even the women indulge.&nbsp; The
transplanting ought to commence from the 12th to the 15th of
June, and ought to be finished by the Amavasya of Asharh, but
this is a moveable feast.&nbsp; On the Krishna Chaturdasi, which
happens on the day preceding the Amavasya, the Maha Rani or
Queen, with her slave girls, (Ketis,) transplant a small plot
within the palace, and it is reckoned an unlucky circumstance
when this is not the last planted field in the valley..&nbsp; The
fields are always kept under water, and weeds are not
troublesome.&nbsp; The few that spring up are removed by the
spud.&nbsp; This crop begins to ripen about the 15th of October,
and by the 1st of November the harvest is completed, after which
a considerable portion of the land is cultivated for wheat or
other winter crops.</p>
<p>The Puya rice is cut down close by the ground.&nbsp; The finer
kinds of rice are immediately thrashed, as is likewise all that
which is intended for seed; but the greater part is made into
what is called Hakuya.&nbsp; This is done with a view of
correcting its unwholesome quality: for all the grain produced in
the valley of Nepal is thought by the natives to be of a
pernicious nature.&nbsp; The manner of preparing Hakuya is as
follows: The corn, immediately after having been cut, is put into
heaps, ten or twelve feet diameter, and six or eight feet in
height.&nbsp; These are covered with wet earth, and allowed to
heat for from eight to twelve days, and till they may be seen
<!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>smoking like lime-kilns.&nbsp; After this the heaps are
opened, and the grain is separated from the straw by beating it
against a piece of ground made smooth for the purpose.&nbsp; Both
grain and straw are then dried in the sun.&nbsp; The grain is
called Hakuya, and the straw is the fuel commonly used by the
poor, for fire-wood is very dear.&nbsp; According to the accounts
received by Colonel Crawford, this manner of preserving rice was
discovered by accident.&nbsp; Many years ago one of the towns was
besieged by an enemy that came so suddenly as not to allow the
citizens time to gather in the crop, which had just then been
cut.&nbsp; The citizens, rather than allow the enemy to benefit
by their corn, determined to throw it into the water and cover it
with earth.&nbsp; In this manner it remained about a week, when
the enemy were compelled to retire.&nbsp; When the grain was
taken up it was found to have begun to rot, but necessity having
compelled the people to eat it, they found, to their
astonishment, that it was much better and more salutary than the
grain which had been prepared in the usual manner.&nbsp; It is
only the Newars that eat this Hakuya.</p>
<p>The crops of rice in Nepal appeared to me very poor when
compared with those of Bengal; and, if my Brahman was rightly
informed concerning the extent of a rupini, they are really
so.&nbsp; The rupini produces four muris of paddy, or 9-376/1000
bushels, but near Calcutta the biga (supposed to be of the same
extent) of good ground produces often 640 sers, or 19-82/100
bushels.&nbsp; The difference of price, however, in the two
countries makes the value of the produce in Nepal the greater of
the two.&nbsp; I have already stated that the value of four muris
of paddy in Nepal is usually 13M. 2A. 2D., or about 54
rupees.&nbsp; But near Calcutta in harvest the usual price of 640
sers of paddy, is 5 rupees 5 A. 4 P.&nbsp; If no error has been
made in estimating the extent of a rupini, the acre of good <!--
page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>land in Nepal produces rather more than 28 bushels of
paddy, or rice in the husk.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Puya crop has been cut, the ground is
formed into beds by throwing the earth out of parallel trenches
upon the intermediate spaces.&nbsp; On these about the middle of
November is sown wheat, or sometimes a little barley.&nbsp; These
ripen without farther trouble, and are cut from the 12th of April
to the 12th of May.&nbsp; The seed for a rupini is stated to be
one pati, and the produce is stated to be two muris.&nbsp; This
would make the seed about the fifth part of a bushel an acre, and
the produce about fourteen bushels; but this seems to me greatly
exaggerated.&nbsp; I have never seen more wretched crops, and
most of the fields of wheat are quite choked with hemp,
(<i>Cannabis sativa</i>,) which in Nepal is a troublesome and
useless weed.&nbsp; The wheat and barley are mostly used for
making fermented or distilled liquors.</p>
<p>Pangdu Kodo, or Maruya, is the <i>Cynosurus Corocanus</i> of
Linn&aelig;us, of which I saw much growing on some of the higher
parts of the plain.&nbsp; It seems to thrive well.&nbsp; The
Maruya is sown from the 13th of June to the 14th of July, and
twenty days afterwards is transplanted.&nbsp; It is ripe about
the middle of September, and produces four muris a rupini.</p>
<p>In thrashing this corn, Colonel Crawford saw the Newars 
<a href="images/p226.jpg">
<img alt=
"Flail"
title=
"Flail"
src="images/p226.jpg" />
</a> using a kind of flail, an implement which I have never
observed in India.&nbsp; Three pieces of Bamboo, about eighteen
inches long, were fastened together in a parallel manner, at
about a finger&rsquo;s breadth asunder, and then fixed to a peg,
which passed through a hole in the end of a longish pole that was
a little bent.&nbsp; The instrument seemed to require
considerable dexterity in its management, but appeared to answer
the purpose intended.</p>
<p><!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>The Sana Kodo of the Parbatiyas is probably the
Paspalum kora of Wildenow.&nbsp; It also is transplanted, ripens
in October and November, and produces as much as the Pangdu
Kodo.</p>
<p>The Muccai and Muruli of the Parbatiyas are both by the Newars
called <i>Kaunguni</i>, and are varieties of the <i>Holcus
sorghum</i>.&nbsp; They are chiefly planted in the small vallies
that open into the plain, and on high terraces, that have a bad
supply of water.</p>
<p>The Urid, or Kala Mas of the Parbatiyas, is by the Newars
called May; and Dr Roxburgh, in his manuscripts, calls it
<i>Phaseolus minimoo</i>, from its Telinga name.&nbsp; In Nepal
this is the most common pulse.&nbsp; It is sown about the 1st of
July, and reaped about the 1st of September.&nbsp; A rupini
produces about ten patis, or an acre about three bushels and a
half.</p>
<p>The Seta Mas of the Parbatiyas, or Chica May of the Newars, Dr
Roxburgh has raised from seed, which I sent from Nepal.&nbsp; He
thinks it a new species, which he calls <i>Phaseolus
ocultatus</i>.&nbsp; It is sown about the 1st of July, reaped the
1st of October, and produces the same quantity that the urid
does.</p>
<p>The Lato, Rato, or Ruta mas of the Parbatiyas, is by the
Newars called Hayngu may.&nbsp; It also appears to Dr Roxburgh to
be an undescribed species, and he has given it the name of
<i>Phaseolus calcaratus</i>.&nbsp; It is sown and reaped at the
same time with the preceding, and yields the same produce.</p>
<p>The Lal mung of the Parbatiyas is also called Hayngumay by the
Newars.&nbsp; The seeds of this plant, which I sent to the
botanical garden, show it to be a <i>Phaseolus</i>, that is by Dr
Roxburgh considered as a nondescript, and he calls it the
<i>Phaseolus racemosus</i>.</p>
<p>The Mung of the Parbatiyas, and the Muk or Mugy may <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>of
the Newars, is the Dolichos Mungo of Linn&aelig;us.&nbsp; Three
manas are sown on a rupini about the 1st of July, and about the
1st of November produce eight patis.</p>
<p>The Seta, and Cala Bhot Mas of the Parbatiyas, are called Musa
and Gya by the Newars.&nbsp; They are two varieties of the
<i>Dolichos soja</i>, the one of which has yellow flowers and
white seeds, and the other has black seeds, and purplish
flowers.&nbsp; The former is ripe about the 1st of November, the
latter about the 1st of September.&nbsp; Their seed and produce
are equal to those of the mung.</p>
<p>The Mosuri of the Parbatiyas, and Mosu of the Newars, is the
<i>Ervum lens</i> of botanists.&nbsp; About the 1st of November
two manas are sown on a rupini; and about May produce twelve
patis.</p>
<p>The same is the case with the Pea, or <i>Pisum arvensis</i>,
called Kerao by the Parbatiyas, and Caigo by the Newars.</p>
<p>The mustard called Sarishi by the Parbatiyas, and Turi by the
Newars is mostly cultivated as a pot-herb.&nbsp; It is sown about
the middle of October, and is cut before it flowers.&nbsp;
Another, which by the Newars is called Ika, is the <i>Sinapis
ramosa</i> of Dr Roxburgh.&nbsp; About the 1st of February two
manas are sown on a rupini, and about April produce two muris of
seed.&nbsp; The ground is afterwards cultivated for rice.</p>
<p>Sesamum is called Til by the Parbatiyas, and Hamo by the
Newars.&nbsp; It grows commonly wild as a weed, but very little
of it is cultivated.</p>
<p>The sugar-cane is planted in considerable quantities, and
seems to thrive.&nbsp; The Newars make a very little extract,
soft sugar, and sugar-candy; but a large proportion of the cane
is eaten without preparation.&nbsp; It is planted about the 1st
of April, and is cut, from the middle of November to the <!--
page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>middle of May.&nbsp; The juice is generally expressed
by a lever.</p>
<p>Ginger, the Puli of the Newars, is planted about the 1st of
April, and dug up in October or November.</p>
<p>The common radishes are by the Parbatiyas called Mulu, and by
the Newars Kipo, and are very much cultivated.&nbsp; They grow in
vast abundance all the year, except from the 15th of November to
the 10th of February.&nbsp; In order to procure a supply of this
useful article, for three months of winter, a large quantity is
sown about the 1st of September, and pulled about the 1st of
November.&nbsp; The roots are then buried in a pit for six or
seven days, during which they seem to undergo a kind of half
putrid fermentation; as when they are taken out of the pit, and
dried in the sun, they exhale a most powerful stench.&nbsp; These
dried roots are called Sinky, keep all winter, and, although
offensive to the smell, enter largely into the diet of the poorer
Newars.&nbsp; These, owing partly to the great quantity of sinky
and of garlic which they eat, and partly to the dirtiness of
their linen, exhale a worse smell than any people I have ever
been among.</p>
<p>Methi, or Fenugreek, grows at all seasons, except from the
15th of November to the 12th of January.&nbsp; It is used only as
a pot-herb, and is the one most commonly consumed in Nepal.</p>
<p>Khira, or cucumbers, grow to great perfection, and with
another cucurbitaceous plant called Kangkari, are ripe from the
13th of June to the 15th of August.</p>
<p>The garlic is planted about the 1st of January, and is taken
up from the 12th of April to the 12th of June.</p>
<p>Bera, or the Solanum Melongena, is sown about the 1st of May,
and is ripe about the 1st of October.</p>
<p>In the hilly parts of the country, the common potatoe <!--
page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>(Solanum tuberosum) has been introduced, and grows
tolerably: but it does not thrive so well as at Patna, owing
probably to a want of care.</p>
<p>The Sakarkandh (Convolvulus batatas) succeeds better.&nbsp; It
is planted about the 1st of April, and is taken up from the
middle of October to the middle of December.</p>
<p>Most of the European kitchen vegetables have been introduced:
but they are only to be found in the gardens of men of
distinction, and in very small quantities.</p>
<p>When Colonel Kirkpatrick visited the country, <a
name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230"
class="citation">[230]</a> the only kitchen vegetables (meaning,
I presume, European) were cabbages and peas, both of which were
of the worst kind.&nbsp; They had, he says, the Thibet turnip,
but cannot raise it any more than the potatoe, without receiving
the seed annually.&nbsp; This, compared with what I observed,
indicates some degree of progressive improvement.</p>
<p>None of their fruits are good, except the oranges and pine
apples; but both of these are in great perfection.&nbsp; The
peach is every where wild, and is also reared in gardens: but it
does not ripen till long after the rainy season has commenced,
and is generally half rotten before it becomes soft.&nbsp; At
Kathmandu the Plantain tree (Musa) dies to the ground in winter,
but the roots are not killed, and in the spring send up fresh
stems.&nbsp; Some good plantains come from Nayakot, and other
valleys, that are situated lower than the capital is.</p>
<p>Such is the account I could procure of the cultivation in the
plains of Nepal.&nbsp; On the sloping faces of the hills,
bounding the smaller vallies in its vicinity, I observed another
mode of cultivation.&nbsp; The soil there is not formed into
terraces; but in April is pared and burned, and then is sown with
Sama, <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>or the <i>Panicum Italicum</i>, with
Tangni or Kakun, which is the <i>Panicum colonum</i>, and with
Kaungni, which is the <i>Holcus Sorghum</i>.&nbsp; When the soil
is in heart, these produce very good crops, and once in the three
or four years the field is allowed a season&rsquo;s fallow.&nbsp;
This seems to be the kind of land which Colonel Kirkpatrick calls
Kohrya. <a name="citation231a"></a><a href="#footnote231a"
class="citation">[231a]</a></p>
<p>In Nepal, the Gangja, Charas, or Cannabis sativa, as I have
already mentioned, is a common weed: but in that country it is
not cultivated, although much used for the purpose of
intoxication.&nbsp; The dried leaves are brought from the
Tariyani, but are reckoned heating, and are not so much used as
the extract, which is called Charas: of this Thibet produces the
best.&nbsp; The proper manner of preparing Charas is by making
incisions into the stem, and collecting the juice, in the same
manner as opium is produced from the capsules of the poppy.&nbsp;
A coarser kind is prepared from the expressed juice of the
hemp.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation231b"></a><a
href="#footnote231b" class="citation">[231b]</a> gives a
different account of the manner of preparing this drug, which, he
says, is procured by rubbing the leaves of the plant Jeea, until
the resin adheres to the fingers, from which it is scraped off
with a spathula.&nbsp; The plant called Jeea is no doubt the
<i>Cannabis sativa</i>, nor can much reliance be placed on the
information which the Colonel received on this subject: as the
person who gave it has evidently been inaccurate, when he stated
concerning the Gangja and Subje produced from the same plant,
that the former is prepared from the flowers and the latter from
the leaves; while, in fact, the one is the dried plant, and the
other the expressed juice.</p>
<p>The dose of Charas is from ten to twelve grains made up into a
pill, which is smoked like tobacco.&nbsp; The dried leaves, or
Gangja, are taken in the same manner, and both produce <!-- page
232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>violent intoxication.&nbsp; While we were in Nepal, a
shopkeeper, who attended the camp, smoked so much Charas that he
died.&nbsp; From the accounts given me by those who saw him, he
became stupid, but not irrational, and complained of nothing
except thirst, for which he two or three times drank water.&nbsp;
As it was not looked upon as any thing extraordinary, I did not
hear of the circumstance till some hours after the man&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; He did not intend to kill himself; but, in the
course of his indulgence, repeated the dose too often.</p>
<p>Two kinds of coarse cotton cloth, called Khadi and Changa, are
woven by the Newar women of all ranks, and by the men of the
Parbatiya cast, called Magar.&nbsp; The cotton grows in the hilly
parts of the kingdom, and is sufficient for the consumption; but
none is exported from Nepal Proper.&nbsp; These cloths constitute
the dress of the middling and lower classes of people, although
woollen would be better fitted for the cold of a Nepal
winter.&nbsp; All those, however, that are not very poor, can
afford to have woollen blankets, which are manufactured by the
Bhotiyas, who even in summer wear no linen.&nbsp; The whole dress
of the higher ranks in Nepal is imported, and consists chiefly of
Chinese silks, shawls, and of the low country muslins and
calicoes.&nbsp; The military alone wear European broad cloth.</p>
<p>In Lalita Patan and Bhatgang there is a very considerable
manufacture of copper, brass, and Phul, which is a kind of
bell-metal.&nbsp; The bells of Thibet are superior to those of
Nepal: but a great many vessels of Phul are made by the Newars,
and exported to Thibet, along with those of brass and
copper.&nbsp; Iron vessels and lamps are also manufactured for
the same market.</p>
<p>A very strong paper, remarkably well fitted for packages, is
made at Bhatgang, from the bark of a shrub, which I call the
<i>Daphne papyrifera</i>.&nbsp; The supply, however, is not
adequate to <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>the demand, and not only the paper,
but a considerable quantity of the raw material is imported from
Bhot.&nbsp; The bark is exceedingly strong and pliable, and seems
to be the same with certain tape-like bandages, employed by the
Chinese in tying many of their parcels.</p>
<p>At Kathmandu the common daily hire for a labouring man is two
anas.&nbsp; Merchants pay three Mohurs for every porter who
brings a load from Hethaura, and five Mohurs from Gar
Pasara.&nbsp; The porter takes three days to come from the
former, and five days from the latter; but he must return empty;
the hire is therefore four anas a day.&nbsp; The usual load is
twenty Dharnis, or a hundred pounds; but some strong men carry a
half more.&nbsp; They carry their loads in a basket called Doka,
of which a representation is given in the plate opposite to page
39 of Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Nepaul.&nbsp; Persons of rank, who do
not choose to walk or ride on horseback, usually travel in what
is called a Dandi, which is a hammock suspended on a pole, and
carried by from four to six men, as represented in the plate
opposite to page 39 of Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s Nepaul.&nbsp; When a
woman goes in a Dandi, a cloth thrown over the pole conceals her
from view.&nbsp; This conveyance is well fitted for a mountainous
country, where few of the roads will admit of the use of a
horse.&nbsp; For a Dandi, to convey them from Kathmandu to Gar
Pasara, merchants pay twenty-four Mohurs: carpenters and
blacksmiths receive three anas a day: bricklayers two anas and a
half: goldsmiths, for every two Mohurs weight of gold they work
up, are allowed four anas: for working silver, they receive
one-sixteenth part of the metal.&nbsp; According to the fineness
of the work, the labourers obtain from one to two Mohurs for
every Darni of copper which they manufacture.</p>
<p>The want of labouring cattle among the Newars renders the
operations of husbandry so tedious, that at many seasons every
<!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>person in the family capable of labour must be
employed; and as no one can be left to take care of the young
children, these must be carried to the field.&nbsp; As this is
often at a distance from the house, the poor villager may be
often seen carrying his infants in two baskets suspended over his
shoulder by a bamboo.&nbsp; In these baskets some food also is
taken, as the family does not return until night.&nbsp; An oblong
mat also forms a usual part of what is carried into the
field.&nbsp; This mat defends the children as well as the
victuals from the sun and rain, and is sometimes used by the
labourers for the same purposes, especially when they are
employed in weeding the rice fields.&nbsp; As that operation is
performed during the rainy season, the labourers would suffer
considerably, unless they kept off the water by a mat tied over
their heads and covering their backs, while their arms are left
at liberty.</p>
<p>In Nepal most of the domestic servants are slaves.&nbsp; A
male slave is called a Keta, and costs about thirty Mohurs.&nbsp;
A female is called Keti, and costs about the same price; but, if
young and handsome, she will bring ten Mohurs additional.&nbsp;
There are some Brahmans who are slaves even to Rajputs: but they
are not degraded by the name Keta, and are employed in great
families, either as cooks, or in the service of the private
chapels.&nbsp; All other ranks are sold for common slaves: and
persons of the best families have often been degraded by the
Rajas, and given to the Damais or Tailors, by which they lose not
only their liberty, but their cast, which is of more importance
to a Hindu.&nbsp; In general, however, among the higher tribes,
the cast of the slave is respected, and no duty is imposed on
him, by which that would be injured.&nbsp; It is reckoned very
disgraceful for any persons but those of the lowest rank, to sell
their children to any person of impure birth, or who is an
infidel.&nbsp; Still, however, this is occasionally done by
persons of <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>high birth, who happen to be in
necessitous circumstances; nor do the parents on this account
lose cast.&nbsp; They would, however, inevitably become outcasts,
should they ever afterwards admit their child into their house,
even were he to be set at liberty by his master.&nbsp; Most of
the slaves, it must be observed, have been born free.&nbsp; A few
have been degraded, and sold by the Raja on account of crimes
alleged against them: but by far the greater part have been sold
by necessitous parents.&nbsp; All the Ketis, even those belonging
to the Queen, are prostitutes, and therefore seldom have
children.&nbsp; The masters in general do not give their slave
girls any other allowance than a small quantity of rice; and a
great many of them are so obdurate, that even this allowance is
stopped, when sickness prevents the slave from working.&nbsp; The
poor creatures are therefore forced to sacrifice their chastity,
in order to procure clothing; and beggary is the usual resource
of those who are old and infirm.&nbsp; The Ketis of the court,
indeed, are allowed some privileges, and have a considerable
influence among the young men of family.&nbsp; In the day time
they attend the Maha Rani or queen; and when she goes out, some
of them armed with swords follow her on horseback, and form her
body guard.&nbsp; They are well dressed, and ride astride like
men.&nbsp; They are allowed to carry on intrigues with any person
of good birth: but the young Rajputs of the guard are their usual
favourites.&nbsp; Some Brahmans and Bankers from the low country,
induced by the beauty of these girls, have formed connexions with
them; but they have in general paid dearly for their
indulgence.&nbsp; Fidelity to one mistress is not a virtue among
such men, and the Ketis of the court think the whole corps bound
to punish any infidelity against one of their number, nor will
the police interfere to prevent them from <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>plundering
the delinquent of his whole property.&nbsp; The slaves of private
persons are not only ill fed, but are hardly wrought.&nbsp; The
common duties imposed on them are to wash, to bring fire-wood
from the mountains, to clean the cooking utensils and the house,
and to carry the umbrella.</p>
<p>Rice is the great article of support in Nepal.&nbsp; Along
with their rice the poorest people eat raw garlic and radishes;
they also fry radishes, fenugreek, or lentiles, in water mixed
with salt, capsicum, and turmeric.&nbsp; To these, people in more
easy circumstances add oil or ghiu; and those who are rich add a
great deal of animal food.&nbsp; Even the poorest are able
occasionally to sacrifice a pigeon, a fowl, or a duck, and of
course they eat these birds.&nbsp; No Hindu eats any meat but the
flesh of sacrifices; for he considers it as a sin to kill any
animal for the purpose of indulging his appetite; but, when a
sacrifice has been offered, the votary may without blame eat what
the Deity does not use.&nbsp; We observed, that even the Rajputs
in Nepal were so fond of animal food, that, to the utter
astonishment of our low country Hindus, they drank the blood of
the sacrifices as it flowed from the victim.</p>

<p>Immediately west from Nepal Proper is a country of
considerable extent, which had long consisted of 24 petty
estates, whose chiefs were collectively called the Chaubisi
Rajas.&nbsp; Yet it would not appear that they were all connected
by any common union for defence, by a common extraction, or by
any other tie.&nbsp; They all, indeed, acknowledged the
superiority of the Yumila Raja, of whom some account will be
afterwards given; but besides these 24 chiefs, he had many others
in similar dependence, which, however, conferred very little
authority on the superior, whose power seems chiefly to have been
confined to exhort his vassals in the support of a balance of
power, and to confer the mark (Tica) of supreme authority on the
heirs of each chief.&nbsp; His superior rank was, however, <!--
page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>never disputed, and his call seems long to have met
with a good deal of attention, when directed to procure
assistance, in preventing one chief from swallowing up the
dominions of another.&nbsp; The 24 chiefs, according to Kanak
Nidhi, were the Rajas mentioned in the following list; but other
lists differ considerably.</p>

<p>Of the other lists, which I received, it would be useless to
give a detail, but I shall mention that given to Colonel
Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation238"></a><a href="#footnote238"
class="citation">[238]</a> referring to the names given in my
list by prefixing the number.&nbsp; (21) Loomjoong.&nbsp; (15)
Kashki.&nbsp; (20) Tunhoo or Tunnohoo.&nbsp; (3) Gulkoat.&nbsp;
(2) Purbut or Mullibum.&nbsp; (14) Noakote or Nuwakote.&nbsp;
(11) Pyoon.&nbsp; (12) Luttohoon.&nbsp; (10) Gurhoon.&nbsp; (18)
Reesing.&nbsp; (19) Ghering.&nbsp; (16) Dhoar.&nbsp; (9)
Palpa.&nbsp; (8) Goolmi.&nbsp; Wigha.&nbsp; (7) Khanchi.&nbsp;
Dang.&nbsp; (24) Musikote.&nbsp; (1) Purthana.&nbsp;
Jhilli.&nbsp; Suliana.&nbsp; (5) Dhoorkote; and (4) Isma.&nbsp;
He thus omits Gorkha, Tarki, Gajarkot, and Argha of the list
which I have given; although I suspect, that his Wigha is no
other than Argha, for in page 288, he reckons Urghaloor as one of
the 24 chiefs, and in page 297 he speaks of the territories of
the Urgho Raja.&nbsp; I have indeed little doubt, that <!-- page
239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>Wigha is a mistake of the editor for Urgho, and that
Urghaloor was originally written Urghapoor, poor or pura being a
common termination of the names of Indian cities.&nbsp; Gorkha
was probably omitted by the Gorkhali who gave him the
information; as its being included would have been acknowledging
the former supremacy of Yumila, which the chiefs of Gorkha now
wish to disavow.&nbsp; In place of Tarki and Gajarkot, Colonel
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s list introduces Dang and Jhilli, (Chhilli,)
both of which I have placed in the class containing twenty-two
chiefs, although perhaps on slender grounds.</p>
<p>Several of these chiefs had entered with others into leagues
for mutual defence, as the interpositions of Yumila, although of
some weight, were by no means sufficient to procure
security.&nbsp; The leagues were sometimes connected by a common
descent in the chiefs, and such were called Athabhai, or eight
brothers; while other leagues were composed of chiefs who were of
different origins.&nbsp; Such leagues were called Satbhai, or
seven brothers.</p>
<p>Among the leagues I heard of the following:</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Lamjun was at the head of a league composed of
Tanahung and Kaski; but Tanahung was followed in war by Dhor, and
Kaski by Satahung, without any reference to the union of these
states with Lamjun.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Birkot was at the head of a league containing
Garahang, Poin, and Nayakot.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Palpa was at the head of a league composed of
Gajarkot, Rising, Ghiring, Argha, Khachi, and Gulmi.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Malebum had in alliance Gulkot.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; Piuthana had in alliance Musikot and Isma, and also
the two petty chiefs of Khungri and Bhingri, who, although their
territories were surrounded by those of the Chaubisiya Rajas,
were not included in the number of these chiefs.</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>Gorkha, I was informed, was always completely
unconnected, and independent of all these alliances; nor did I
learn that Dhurkot or Tarki were in a contrary situation.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to give an account of the chiefs who
governed this assembly of states, and of their countries.</p>
<p>I have already given an account of the family of highest rank,
including the Rajas of Palpa, Tanahung, Rising, Ghiring, and
Gajarkot; because this family possessed also large estates to the
east of Nepal Proper.&nbsp; It therefore remains to describe the
other 19 states.</p>
<p>I shall first mention the family which at present has obtained
almost universal empire over the mountains north from the
Company&rsquo;s provinces, and does not content itself with a
gentle rule, such as that exercised by the Rajas of Yumila, but
has seized the entire dominion and power of the conquered
countries, and assumes a menacing countenance even to the
Company.</p>
<p>The family pretends to be of the Pamar tribe; but it is
alleged, as I have already explained, that this is a mere fable,
and that, on the arrival of the colony from Chitaur, this family
were Magars.&nbsp; One of its branches, however, has long adopted
the Hindu rules of purity, and has intermarried with the best
families, although not without creating disgust; and the other
branch remains in primitive impurity, although we have seen that
the same is the case with the Chauhans, who long pretended to a
great superiority over the chiefs of Gorkha.</p>
<p>The first persons of the Gorkha family, of whom I have heard,
were two brothers named Khancha and Mincha, or Nimcha, words
altogether barbarous, and in no manner resembling the high
sounding titles of the family of the sun, from whom the Pamars
pretend to be descended.&nbsp; From whence these persons came, I
did not learn; but Khancha was the founder of the <!-- page
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>impure branch of the family, and Mincha was the chief
of Nayakot.</p>
<p>The impure branch of the family possessed Bhirkot, Garahang,
and Dhor, which afterwards separated under three chiefs of the
same house; but Bhirkot seems to have been the head of the whole,
as its chief was at the head of a league containing Nayakot, the
most ancient family of the pure descendants of Mincha.&nbsp;
Bhirkot is a very petty state, consisting entirely of mountains,
and containing neither mines nor mart of any consequence.</p>
<p>The same is the case with Garahang, whose chief adhered to the
league with his kinsman of Bhirkot.&nbsp; The capital, (Rajdhani
or Durbar,) of the same name with the country, is situated on the
top of a hill, with no water nearer than a cose.&nbsp; In such a
situation, only 60 or 70 huts surrounded the chief&rsquo;s
castle, which was built of brick.</p>
<p>The impure chief of Dhor did not join in the league of his
kinsmen; but followed in battle the pure chiefs of
Tanahung.&nbsp; His country was as petty and as mountainous as
that of his kinsmen, but contained some iron mines.</p>
<p>I now return to Mincha, whose descendants were reclaimed from
their impurity by the Brahmans.</p>
<p>Mincha was Raja of Nayakot, and the chiefs of this place,
although they lived pure, continued to the last to follow in war
the impure representative of Khancha, who governed Bhirkot.&nbsp;
Nayakot was very petty; but, besides the capital, contained a
town of some note, named Limi, but no mines of any
consequence.</p>
<p>A collateral branch of the Nayakot Rajas obtained a similar
state called Satahung, which, besides the capital, contained a
town called Gengdi.&nbsp; The capital, of the same name with the
territory, is situated on a hill, and contained about 250 <!--
page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>thatched huts, besides the brick castle of the
chief.&nbsp; In the whole territory there might have been 1500
houses.&nbsp; The Raja&rsquo;s share of the land revenue amounted
to 2000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; He followed in war the chief of
Kaski.&nbsp; The most numerous tribe among his subjects was the
Khasiya.</p>
<p>A second collateral branch of the Nayakot family was Kaski, a
more powerful state than that of the chief from which it
sprang.&nbsp; I believe that the territory of this chief towards
the hills was much wider than is represented in the map of Kanak,
for I was informed, that Gorkha had no communication with the
Bhotiyas, his country being narrowed there between Kaski and
Nepal.&nbsp; It may, however, have happened, that the want of
communication was owing to the impracticability of the mountains,
and not to the shortness of the frontier.&nbsp; The chiefs of
Kaski leagued with Lamjun, a collateral branch of their own
family, but had as a follower in war their kinsman of
Satahung.&nbsp; Although adjacent to the mountains covered with
perpetual snow, the southern parts are rather warmer than the
valley of Nepal Proper, but the parts adjacent to the snowy peaks
were inhabited by Bhotiyas, and next to these were some
Gurungs.&nbsp; The warmer parts were occupied by Brahmans,
Khasiyas, and the persons of low tribes necessary as
artisans.&nbsp; The mountains here formed an uninterrupted and
impenetrable barrier towards the north.&nbsp; The chief possessed
some mines of copper; and, besides the capital, there is a
considerable town called Pokhara, which is a mart frequented by
merchants from Nepal, Palpa, Malebum, etc. and afforded duties
that in so poor a country were reckoned considerable.&nbsp; The
capital by Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation242"></a><a
href="#footnote242" class="citation">[242]</a> is called
Buttolachoor, is situated among hills on the Seti river, (Saite,
K.) which is very deep but narrow.</p>
<p>Kaski, the ancient capital, Colonel Kirkpatrick places 7 coses
<!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>west from Buttolachoor, with Surrungkoat, a large town
with a fort on a hill between them.</p>
<p>The chief of Lamjun was descended from a younger son of Kaski,
and was originally powerful, the sum appropriated from the land
revenue, for his family expense, being 22,000 rupees a-year; and
he was not only followed in war by his kinsman the chief of
Kaski, but by the Raja of Tanahung.&nbsp; Lamjun, after the loss
of Gorkha, was a cold country bordering on the snowy peaks of
Emodus, and inhabited by Bhotiyas, with some Brahmans and
Khasiyas in the warmer vallies.&nbsp; It contained no mine of any
importance, nor any town of note, except the capital; and the
chief advantage, after the loss of Gorkha, that the Raja enjoyed,
was the commerce with Bhotan or Thibet, which was carried on
through a passage in Emodus called Siklik.&nbsp; Many goods were
conveyed by this route to Lamjun, and from thence, by the way of
Tarku, Tanahung, Dewghat, and Bakra, into the low country; but
this trade has been interdicted by the present government of
Nepal, which is very jealous of the Raja of Tanahung, to whom
Bakra still is secured by the Company&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp;
Siklik, however, is still the residence of a Subah or civil
governor, and is probably the place called Seshant in the map of
Kanak.&nbsp; The name merely implies a frontier place, but among
the hills is used to imply a place inhabited by barbarians; that
is, such as reject the doctrines of the Brahmans.&nbsp; In both
meanings the term is applicable to Siklik, as its inhabitants,
Bhotiyas and Gurungs adhere to the Lamas, and it is the frontier
town towards the empire of China.</p>
<p>One of the Lamjun Rajas, according to Prati Nidhi, had a
younger brother named Darbha Sahi, who as usual held the office
of Chautariya; but rebelled, and took to himself Gorkha, <!--
page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>the southern part of the principality, paying 12,000
rupees of the 22,000 that came to the chief for his support.</p>
<p>Gorkha is rather warmer than the valley of Nepal, and its
chief inhabitants were Brahmans and Khasiyas, in about equal
numbers, with rather fewer Magars, the Brahmans being the chief
cultivators, and the Khas and Magars the fighting men.&nbsp; The
capital Gorkha is situated on a very high hill, and was the only
place of note in the territory.&nbsp; It is said to contain about
2000 houses, and the temple of Gorakhanath, who is one of the
tutelar deities of the reigning family.&nbsp; From this
circumstance we may perhaps infer, that the proper name of the
place is Gorakha, and that, previous to having adopted the
doctrines of the Brahmans, this family had received the Zogis, or
priests of Gorakhanath, as their spiritual guides.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation244"></a><a
href="#footnote244" class="citation">[244]</a> states the old
boundaries of Gorkha to have been the Trisulganga (Tirsoolgunga)
on the east, and the Marichangdi (Mursiangdi) on the west.&nbsp;
In place of the former he should have stated the Gandi; but from
what he says, (in page 122,) it would seem that he confounded the
Gandi with both the Setiganga and Trisulganga.</p>
<p>Nara Bhupal or Nribhupala, according to Prati Nidhi, was the
sixth or seventh in descent from Darbha.&nbsp; The account which
I received in Nepal does not materially differ.&nbsp; The first
chief of Gorkha was, however, there called Rama Sahi, whether a
different name for Darbha, or his son, I do not know; but his
descendants were as follows: 1.&nbsp; Puran.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;
Chhatra.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Dambar.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Virbhadra.&nbsp;
5.&nbsp; Prithwi Pati.&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Nribhupal.&nbsp; These
chiefs entered into none of the leagues formed by their <!-- page
245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>neighbours, trusting to their own vigour chiefly, for
their country was very poor.</p>
<p>The chiefs of Gorkha being cut off from any direct
communication with either the low country or Thibet, and having
no mines nor other productions as a basis for commerce, were
considered as insignificant, but Nribhupal procured in marriage,
first, a daughter of the Palpa family; and, secondly, a daughter
of the sixth son of the chief of Malebum, both of whom added much
to his dignity.</p>
<p>His eldest son Prithwi Narayan (Purthi Nerayn in Kirkpatrick)
was a person of insatiable ambition, sound judgment, great
courage, and unceasing activity.&nbsp; Kind and liberal,
especially in promises to his friends and dependants, he was
regardless of faith to strangers, and of humanity to his enemies,
that is, to all who opposed his views.</p>
<p>When a very young man, he visited Banaras, and having met with
what he considered insolence at some (Chauki) custom-house,
instantly put the officers to death.&nbsp; He was concealed from
the police by a (Vairagi) person dedicated to religion, who,
induced by most abundant promises, conveyed the highland chief in
safety to his cousin, Makunda Sen, Raja of Palpa, by whom he was
very kindly received, and furnished with the means which enabled
him to undertake his first enterprises.&nbsp; I have already
mentioned the manner in which he repaid this friendship, and in
which he conquered the countries that the Chitaur colony held on
the east of the Gandaki.&nbsp; Some account of the invasion of
Nepal by this chief is given by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245"
class="citation">[245]</a> and in the Asiatick Researches will be
found a more full narration by an eye-witness of the manner in
which he acquired that country, <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>to which he
immediately transferred the seat of government, although his
nobles and soldiers despise the name of Nepal, and call
themselves Gorkhalis.&nbsp; I have also mentioned his total
failure in an attempt to extend his dominions to the west,
towards which, during the remainder of his government, and that
of his son, the Marichangdi continued to be the boundary to the
west, as it had been in the time of his ancestors.</p>
<p>The Vairagi, who had saved the life of Prithwi Narayan at
Banaras, no sooner heard of the conquest of Nepal, than he
repaired to that country, and reminded the chief of his
promises.&nbsp; These the chief did not attempt to deny; but
said, that, as the promises had been extorted by fear, he would
give nothing.&nbsp; The Vairagi, having assembled 500 of the
religious order of Nagas, attempted to use force; but the whole
horde was taken, and put to death, an event of great use to
Bengal, which these ruffians had been in the habit of
plundering.</p>
<p>Prithwi Narayan, besides his personal endowments, was much
indebted for success to the introduction of firelocks, which
until his time were totally unknown among the hills; and, so far
as he was able, he introduced European discipline, the value of
which he fully appreciated.&nbsp; His jealousy of the European
character always, however, prevented him from employing any of
them in his service, and he is said to have strongly recommended
to his successors to follow, in this respect, his example.&nbsp;
How far this may have been judicious, I cannot say; but it has
certainly prevented his troops, although in many respects well
organized, from making considerable progress in tactics, or in a
dexterous use of their arms, and these are probably much more
defective than his descendants and their officers think.</p>
<p>Prithwi Narayan died about the year 1771, and left two
legitimate sons; Singha Pratap, who succeeded his father, and
<!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>Bahadur Sahi, who, after his brother&rsquo;s death, was
regent of the kingdom during his nephew&rsquo;s minority,
although he had excited the jealousy of Singha Pratap, and had
with difficulty saved his life by living in exile.</p>
<p>Singha Pratap&rsquo;s attention, as I have mentioned, was
chiefly directed to secure the conquests towards the east, in
which, as I have said, he seems to have had as few scruples as
usual in his family.&nbsp; He died in 1775, at Devighat, and left
his kingdom to his son Rana Bahadur, placed in charge of his
uncle Bahadur Sahi, a very active enterprising prince, and of his
mother Rajendra Lakshmi, a princess of a similar character.</p>
<p>Two such enterprising personages could not agree: and, until
the princess&rsquo;s death, there were constant disputes,
sometimes the one, and sometimes the other, acquiring the
ascendancy, and then confining or banishing their
adversary.&nbsp; Yet it is alleged, that in times of
reconciliation, marriage had been proposed between them, the
custom of the lower casts of Hindus, at least, not only
permitting, but requiring a younger brother to espouse his elder
brother&rsquo;s widow.&nbsp; That such a proposal should ever
have been made, being contrary to the customs which at present
prevail among the high casts, is rather improbable; and, perhaps,
owes its origin to a desire of flattering Rana Bahadur, whose
treatment of his uncle required an apology.&nbsp; The people of
Palpa indeed allege, that, during the life of Singha Pratap, a
more criminal intercourse had actually taken place between the
two regents, and that it was to revenge the disgrace thrown on
his family, that Rana Bahadur proceeded to extremities against
his uncle.&nbsp; Were this true, the attempt to unite their
differences by a marriage might be supposed possible: but I
attribute the origin of such a story to the disappointed hopes of
the Palpa family, which, after having entered into an iniquitous
league with Bahadur <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Sahi, found itself in consequence
reduced to a state of dependancy.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the manner in which Bahadur Sahi thus
connected himself with the Palpa family, and the success that
attended Damodar Pangre, the officer who was most judiciously
employed, and who then held the office of Karyi.&nbsp; Except
Palpa, and its share of the spoil, this officer speedily reduced
the whole country from Gorkha to the boundary of the country
called Garhawal, the capital of which is Srinagar.&nbsp; At the
same time, the dominion of Gorkha was extended over the Sikim
Bhotiyas of the east, as I have already mentioned; and several
other chiefs of the Bhotiya nation towards the north were reduced
to obedience.</p>
<p>So far the greatest success had attended the regent, when he
was tempted to adopt a very rash measure.&nbsp; Sumur, a
discontented brother of the Tishu Lamas from Degarchi, came to
Nepal, and told the needy chief wonderful stories concerning the
wealth of the convent, in which the Tishu Lama, spiritual guide
of the Chinese Emperor, resided.&nbsp; Inflamed with a desire for
plunder, and without having the slightest pretence or intercourse
with that priest, a large body of Gorkhalis (it is said 7000)
overcame all the obstructions of a long and very difficult route,
and succeeded in carrying back a large booty, although closely
pursued by a Chinese army, that came to the assistance of the
Lama.&nbsp; This army having been greatly increased, about the
time when Colonel Kirkpatrick visited Nepal, advanced to
Dhayabung, and compelled the regent to submit to several
indignities, although it had suffered severely from the climate,
and the poverty of the country.&nbsp; For the particulars,
however, I may refer to the Account of Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a
name="citation248a"></a><a href="#footnote248a"
class="citation">[248a]</a> and of Captain Turner, <a
name="citation248b"></a><a href="#footnote248b"
class="citation">[248b]</a> whose opportunities <!-- page
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>of
acquiring information were superior to mine.&nbsp; So far as I
can learn, the people of Gorkha were very much discontented with
the regent for submitting to the indignities which the Chinese
demanded; and they seem to have thought, that the invading army
had been reduced to a situation rather to offer than demand
submission.&nbsp; The submission was, however, not impolitic; for
I believe, that the tribute agreed upon has never even been
demanded, much less expected, and the Gorkhalis are in the habit
of saying, that, should they have any dispute with the English,
their only formidable neighbour, they will claim the protection
of the Chinese, with whose influence over the Company they seem
to be much better acquainted than one would have expected.&nbsp;
The Chinese general consented to move back on receiving a supply
of grain for his army, and fifty virgins as an homage for his
sovereign; but no stipulation was made for the restoration of the
plunder of Degarchi.&nbsp; It was given out at Kathmandu, that
the virgins threw themselves from the precipices on the route,
and perished rather than submit to the embraces of infidels
defiled by every impure food: but I have since learned, that
their sense of honour did not carry them to such lengths, and
that the Chinese placed them in a convent near the
frontier.&nbsp; The people of Thibet procured no satisfaction for
the injury, and Chinese garrisons having been placed through
their country, they have become more subject than ever to that
empire, and most of their petty chiefs have been put to death or
banished, while the Chinese have since extended their conquests
still farther west.&nbsp; The dominions of Nepal are therefore
the only thing that separates them from the British power, and
saves them from political discussions, managed free from the
control of their own forms, and from exposing to their officers
and people the view of a nation far their superior in power.</p>
<p><!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>It is alleged, that at length the regent&rsquo;s
ambition overcame his sense of duty, and that he intended to keep
his nephew in confinement, and seize the government.&nbsp; The
people of Palpa allege, that he had secured the assistance of his
brother-in-law Mahadatta Sen.&nbsp; Certain it is, that he was
suddenly dispossessed of power by his nephew, and died in
confinement, some say by the Raja&rsquo;s own hand, while others
assert that he was starved to death.</p>
<p>Bahadur Sahi, although a prince of great vigour, is supposed
to have been uncommonly superstitious; yet from some anecdotes
related by Colonel Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation250"></a><a
href="#footnote250" class="citation">[250]</a> it would appear,
that he was very capable of evading with skill the performance of
troublesome ceremonies, and that he could speak on religion with
the popish missionaries without harshness, but with a
considerable quickness of repartee.&nbsp; His superstition was
probably, therefore, of that nature which is usually assumed by
princes placed in difficult situations.</p>
<p>Rana Bahadur received little or no education from his
guardians, but was allowed to indulge in every vice, surrounded
by minions and young profligates of the court.&nbsp; These not
only assisted him in the pursuit of low vices, but encouraged his
natural propensity to cruel diversions.&nbsp; He had no sooner
secured his rights to the throne, and assumed the power of the
state, than he showed the restless ambition of his family by an
attack on the Yumila Raja, whom all the mountain chiefs
acknowledged as their liege lord.&nbsp; The Yumila chief,
although he had been thrown off his guard by all manner of
professions, having an extensive territory, made a stout
resistance, but was finally compelled to seek refuge in the
country of the Vazir.</p>
<p><!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>Rana Bahadur had married a daughter of the Gulmi Raja,
to whom he showed some favour, compelling the Raja of Palpa to
give up to that chief several estates, of which he had been
stript by Mahadatta Sen; but, perhaps being disgusted by his
wife&rsquo;s having no children, he soon neglected that virtuous
and high-minded lady, and very openly cohabited with other
women.&nbsp; He first had a son by a common slave girl, and then
one by the daughter of a Brahman.&nbsp; This gave great offence
to the sacred order, but the ungovernable fury of the
Raja&rsquo;s temper hushed all complaints.&nbsp; As a means of
disturbing him, however, the skilful in astrology (Jyotish)
published a prophecy, foretelling that the Raja would not long
survive his beauteous favourite of the sacred order, who would
soon be seized with a disease.&nbsp; As the latter circumstance
happened, the Raja, who, like other Hindus, had no doubt in the
science, was in the utmost consternation.&nbsp; Some of the
learned took immediate advantage, and informed him, that, by
certain ceremonies performed before a certain image, his
favourite might be restored to health.&nbsp; The Raja, caught by
this device, advanced what was held to be a very large sum, it is
said 100,000 rupees; but without effect, for his favourite died
in a few days.&nbsp; The Raja&rsquo;s ungovernable temper now
fully disclosed itself.&nbsp; He not only scourged the Brahmans
to make them disgorge his money, but he took the image, and,
grinding it to pieces with excrement, threw the fragments into a
river.&nbsp; His fears, however, were not abated, and the people,
disgusted and terrified at his violence, were ripe for
change.&nbsp; It was judiciously suggested to him, that, as he
could not expect to survive long, he should endeavour to secure
the government to the son of his favourite, by placing him
immediately on the throne, (Gadi,) and by making all ranks take
the oaths of fidelity to the child.&nbsp; The Raja approved
entirely of <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>this measure, and determined to end
his days at Banaras, and thus to secure a place in heaven.&nbsp;
Every step, however, was taken to secure the young Raja&rsquo;s
authority.&nbsp; The Raja of Palpa was invited to place the mark
of royalty (Tika) on his forehead, and some of the conquered
chiefs, I believe chiefly those descended of Khancha and Mincha,
were induced to be present, and promised an annual pension, on
condition of their acknowledging the legitimacy of their
illegitimate kinsman: and so much weight has been attached to
this acknowledgment, that the pensions, I am told, are still
continued.</p>
<p>Before all these ceremonies had been performed, much time had
elapsed.&nbsp; Although, therefore, every preparation had been
made for the Raja&rsquo;s departure for Banaras, and although he
had conferred the regency on his surviving favourite the slave
girl, his wife having refused to accept of the office, and having
insisted on accompanying her lord, Rana Bahadur, no longer called
Raja but Swami, finding himself very well, seems to have repented
of what he had rashly done, and suspecting some trick, was
inclined to resume the government.&nbsp; Both people and chiefs
were, however, in general averse to this measure, as the violence
of his temper was universally feared.&nbsp; The chiefs,
therefore, under the direction of Damodar Pangre, informed him,
that they, having sworn obedience to the young Raja, would
support his government.&nbsp; The Raja fortified himself in the
town of Lalita Patan, near the capital, and most of the eastern
provinces were disposed to support his authority; but Damodar had
shown such prudence and mildness, when he conquered the west,
that the people of that quarter were determined to adhere to his
cause.&nbsp; Sadhu Ram alleges, that on this occasion, in the
country between Gorkha Proper and Garhawal, including Palpa, in
the strictest friendship with Damodar, 17,000 men of the sacred
order, and an equal number <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>of the
military tribes, were ready to support this officer.&nbsp; After
some skirmishing, Damodar&rsquo;s party being evidently the
strongest, Rana Bahadur retired privately to Banaras with the
character of insanity but, except in an ungovernable ferocity and
cruelty of temper, and in a credulity, evidently the fault of
education, he seems to have been abundantly judicious, and in
fact finally overreached all his adversaries.</p>
<p>Rana Bahadur having incurred a considerable debt to the
British Government, which supplied his wants at Banaras, a treaty
was entered into for a gradual repayment, and for the residence
of a British officer at Kathmandu; and Captain Knox, with whom I
went, entered their territory in February 1802.&nbsp; We had been
there only a few days, when the officers, who came to meet us,
and who were very friendly disposed, were thrown into great
trouble by the arrival of the princess, Rana Bahadur&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; The unprincipled chief had connected himself with one
of these frail but pure beauties, (Gandharbin,) with which the
holy city abounds, had stript his wife of her jewels to bestow
them on this wanton companion, and finally had turned his wife
out of doors.&nbsp; As the slave regent had the meanness to seize
on the income of the town, assigned for the princess&rsquo;s
dowry, the poor lady was reduced to the utmost distress, and
conceived that we were her enemies, being on an embassy to the
low woman, by whom she had been so shamefully used.&nbsp; She
therefore stirred up to destroy us a certain Masan Raut, who had
under him many thieves and robbers, with whom he plundered the
borders.&nbsp; We received, however, timely notice, and our guard
being all night under arms, no attempt was made, although the
sentries saw hovering round parties of men, who, no doubt, had
come in the expectation of finding some unguarded part.</p>
<p>As might have been expected, under such circumstances, the
<!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>slave girl&rsquo;s regency had been from the first
marked with weakness.&nbsp; The two most powerful chiefs then in
Nepal were Brahma Sahi of the royal family, and Damodar of the
house called Pangre, which, ever since the conquest, has been the
most powerful family among the Gorkhalis.&nbsp; Damodar had
strengthened his influence by the marriage of his sister into the
distinguished family of the Viswanaths, and had procured the
command of most of the fortresses, which he intrusted to the care
of his own dependants.&nbsp; The eldest of his nephews, of the
Viswanath family, was then a fine young man named
Kritimohun.&nbsp; Him the regent appointed Karyi, and in his
abilities reposed the highest confidence, which was supposed to
have been increased by her regard for his person.&nbsp; Far from
supporting his uncle, this rash young man removed all the
adherents of the Pangre family from the command of the
fortresses, and gave them in charge to dependants of his own, and
of Rudravir his illegitimate brother.&nbsp; In the meanwhile,
envy raised against him many enemies, and he was assassinated by
persons of a rank too elevated to be publicly mentioned.&nbsp;
Among these was Sri Krishna Sahi, one of the legitimate princes
of the royal family, who was compelled to fly into the
Company&rsquo;s territory; but the principal odium and suspicion
fell on Damodar Pangre, the young minister&rsquo;s uncle.&nbsp;
As the regent never liked this chief, the circumstance was made a
pretence for attempting his ruin, and for the elevation of Brahma
Sahi to the principal authority in the government.&nbsp; This
personage having joined with two brothers of the Viswanath
family, and with Sher Bahadur, illegitimate brother of Rana
Bahadur, seized on the two sons of Damodar Pangre; but the old
man could not be touched; he was too much versed in affairs, and
was too strongly supported by his friends, and especially by two
warlike brothers.&nbsp; With these he <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>retired
from court; and when Captain Knox approached the frontier, in the
beginning of 1802, was living in sullen retirement.&nbsp; At this
time an apparent reconciliation took place between Brahma Sahi
and Damodar Pangre; both came to receive the English embassy; and
the sons of Damodar were liberated.&nbsp; The probable cause of
this reconciliation was the elevation of a low man to the
principal confidence of the regent, while the charge of her
conscience and heart was in possession of a young Sannyasi or
religious mendicant, one of the finest formed men that I have
ever seen.&nbsp; Both circumstances gave offence to the
people.</p>
<p>On our arrival in the valley of Nepal, in April, we found a
young illegitimate Raja, about six years of age, whose nominal
chief minister, Chautariya, was an illegitimate brother, two
years older than himself, and son of the regent slave girl, who
had in fact given the whole power to a very low person, which
occasioned universal disgust.&nbsp; Damodar Pangre, who had met
us on the frontier, did not accompany us to the court, for what
reason I do not exactly know; but it is probable that he scorned
the low favourite, who had been raised to the chief authority in
the kingdom.&nbsp; The only man of weight at the court was in
fact Brahma Sahi, descended of the royal family; but whether or
not legitimate, I cannot say.&nbsp; He was, however, highly
respected by the people, and has fewer of the vices of his family
than usual, with much good sense and moderation.</p>
<p>Soon after our arrival we learned, that the distressed
princess, spouse of Rana Bahadur, terrified at the thought of
remaining in the unhealthy forests during the rainy season,
deprived of means to support her in the Company&rsquo;s
territory, and probably encouraged by Damodar Pangre, intended to
come up to Nepal without leave; for the regent could not <!--
page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>bear the approach of her former mistress, and yet would
not give her the stipulated dower.&nbsp; People were therefore
sent, who brought up all the male attendants of the princess in
irons; and it was hoped, I believe, that she would perish in the
woods.&nbsp; Necessity, however, added boldness to her measures,
and she advanced with ten or twelve female attendants to
Chisapani, a fortress commanding the entrance into Nepal.&nbsp;
It was evident, however, that the commiseration of the people was
daily gaining strength, and the timidity of the regent gave daily
an increase of power to the princess.&nbsp; An additional company
of Seapoys was sent to Chisapani, as if soldiers were the proper
persons to stop the progress of a few helpless women.&nbsp; The
officer commanding had received positive orders to refuse the
princess admittance; but he contented himself by executing merely
the letter of his orders.&nbsp; He took in all his garrison, shut
the gates, and allowed the lady and her attendants to walk
quietly round the walls.&nbsp; Much anxiety was now evident at
the capital, and another company of Seapoys was dispatched to
Chitlang, with positive orders to prevent the princess from
advancing farther; and, if the arrears of dower had accompanied
the officer, I do not believe that she would have made any
attempt; but the sordid dispositions of the regent and her
favourite did not suffer them to part with money.&nbsp; The
officer commanding the company met the poor princess and her
attendants on the road, and, being a man of true honour, with a
good deal of difficulty mustered courage to disclose his
orders.&nbsp; When he had done so, the high-born lady, unmoved by
fear, pulled out a dagger, and saying, will you presume to oppose
the lawful wife of a Gorkhali Raja, while going to her own
estate? she struck him on the arm; on which, although wounded, he
immediately retired, quite ashamed of the service on which he had
been employed; and his men required no <!-- page 257--><a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>orders to
follow his example.&nbsp; The princess that morning entered the
valley of Nepal, and halted about five miles from the
capital.&nbsp; No sooner was this known than she was joined by
Damodar Pangre, and all ranks flocked to pay their respects, and
among them all the officers of government, except the low
favourite, who immediately fled towards Thibet.</p>
<p>The regent, thus deserted, retired with the Raja and her son
to the sanctuary of a temple, taking with her all the money in
the treasury and the jewels of the crown.&nbsp; Next day the
princess entered the capital, and, after a short negotiation,
took upon herself the regency, and settled on her base-born rival
an income, which, had she received, she would never have given
any trouble.&nbsp; In the whole transaction, indeed, she showed
great magnanimity; and the only stain on her character, so far as
I know, during so difficult a scene, was her conduct to the wife
of the low man, whom the late regent had elevated to the office
of Serdar.&nbsp; This unfortunate woman was put to the torture,
to make her disclose where her husband had concealed his
treasure; but, I believe, the treasure was imaginary, and the
report of his having accumulated wealth arose, I imagine, in base
minds, envious of his sudden rise, and anxious to gratify their
envy by misrepresentations to the princess regent.&nbsp; The man,
indeed, bore on the whole a good character; and the meanness of
his birth and education, with some low conduct, arising more from
these misfortunes than from any inclination to evil, are the only
things for which I ever heard him blamed.</p>
<p>The new regent placed in her chief confidence Damodar Pangre,
the officer in the country of by far the highest reputation; and
although she consulted him chiefly, she expressed great anxiety
for her husband&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; She also showed the utmost
jealousy of the British embassy as likely to interfere <!-- page
258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>with that event; and in the end of March 1802 we left
the capital.&nbsp; It was probably at the instigation of Damodar,
that the Palpa Raja, as I have mentioned, was allowed to return
home.&nbsp; Whether or not these chiefs had entered into any
conspiracy, as has been hinted, I do not know; but it is
generally believed, that Damodar, so far as he was able, opposed
the return of Rana Bahadur, which certainly was neither desirable
for Nepal nor its neighbours.&nbsp; The natives in general
believe, that he wrote a letter to a gentleman of rank at
Banaras, requesting his influence to keep Rana Bahadur at that
city; and that this letter, by the treachery or mistaken policy
of the gentleman, came into the hands of this ferocious
chief.&nbsp; He instantly departed by post, and was in the
dominions of Nepal before any one suspected that he had left
Banaras.&nbsp; He was cordially received by his faithful wife,
although he did not fail to send to Banaras for the wanton
beauty, by whom he had been there captivated, and who must have
cost him great sums, if we can judge from the style in which she
now lives at Banaras, to which she returned on his death.</p>
<p>On his approach to the capital, Rana Bahadur was met by
Damodar Pangre, at the head of a large body of armed men.&nbsp;
This certainly had an alarming appearance, and the intention of a
man so prudent and reserved as Damodar must always remain
uncertain; but the prince, supported by the advice of Bhim Sen, a
young attendant, showed no sign of fear, and called aloud to the
officers and men, &ldquo;Now show whether you will have me or
Damodar for your lord?&rdquo; on which the whole joined him, and
the gallant veteran, and his eldest son, were bound.</p>
<p>Rana Bahadur contented himself with the title of Swami or
Lord, and, finding that the oath of fidelity had still a
considerable influence among the troops, acted merely as regent
for <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>his son; but, in action, he never
hesitated to assume the full power of the prince.&nbsp; Soon
after, having shown the letter to Damodar, he delivered him and
his son to the public executioner.&nbsp; As leading to the place,
the young man proposed resistance, and a sudden attempt might
have put them in possession of arms, which, with their known
courage, and the veneration for their character, where no higher
authority was present, might have overcome the guard.&nbsp; The
old general, however, recommended submission, lest their attempt
might have proven totally fatal to their house.&nbsp; He appears
to have here also acted with his usual judgment; as his only
surviving son was spared by Rana Bahadur, when treacherously
delivered up by the Palpa Raja, as I have above mentioned; and
the young man, I believe, now holds the office of one of the
Karyis, the whole soldiery viewing the family with affection, and
considering it entitled to have one of its members always in
possession of that dignity.</p>
<p>Immediately after this, Rana Bahadur determined to enlarge his
dominions, and with that view entrusted Bara Amar Singha with a
large force.&nbsp; This officer Rana Bahadur, when he arrived
from Banaras, found in confinement, in which he had been placed
by his old commander, Damodar Pangre, and, on this account, he
was justly considered as more faithful to the prince.&nbsp; He
rapidly seized on Garhawal, and extended the power of Gorkha
beyond the Yamuna; where, had it not been checked by Ranjit
Singha, the Sikh chieftain, it would soon have extended to the
boundary of Kasmira.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the arts by which Rana Bahadur
inveigled Prithwi Pal, and the chief officers of that prince,
into his power; in which he showed no symptoms of insanity,
unless a shameless perfidy be considered as such.&nbsp; His
career, however, was then near a close.&nbsp; Most of the chief
officers <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>were disgusted, and kept in constant
terror by the remembrance of Damodar Pangre&rsquo;s fate, with
whom most of them had been intimately connected; and each daily
expected, that this connection might be made a pretence for his
ruin; for the regent or lord consulted only a young man named
Bhim Sen, vigorous, ambitious, and unprincipled as himself.&nbsp;
A conspiracy is said to have been formed with a view of placing
the Palpa Raja at the head of affairs; and Sher Bahadur, an
illegitimate brother of the regent, who long had held the high
office of Chautariya, is supposed to have been concerned.&nbsp;
In order to remove his brother from such dangerous enterprises,
the regent ordered him to join the army in the field, but he
declined.&nbsp; The regent was then very angry; and, while in
full court, sent for his brother, with orders to bring him by
force if he declined.&nbsp; Sher Bahadur followed the messengers
into the court, and being asked, if he would join the army,
declined by saying, we are sons of the same father, go you and I
will follow.&nbsp; What may be exactly meant by this phrase in an
ambiguous language, I cannot say; certainly, however, it so
enraged Rana, that he ordered his brother for execution; but,
while no one was aware, the brother drew his sword, and gave the
regent a mortal blow.&nbsp; He was instantly put to death by Bhim
Sen, into whose hands the regent, before he expired, delivered
his son, the Raja, and commanded all persons to obey his
authority.</p>
<p>When the Raja expired, Bhim Sen immediately retired to another
room, commanding a view of the court, in which the guard was
assembled, and, having addressed the soldiers, and received a
promise of their support, he immediately surrounded the hall, in
which the court was assembled, and put to death all the most
active persons, under pretence, at least, of the conspiracy, and
there is reason to suspect, that what he <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>alleged was
not destitute of foundation.&nbsp; On this occasion, Bidur Sahi,
an illegitimate son of the royal family, then one of the
Chautariyas, Narasingha Karyi, Tribhuvan Karyi, and about fifty
military officers, were killed.&nbsp; On the same day he put to
death the Palpa Raja, and his chief officers, as has been already
mentioned; and his father, Amar Singha, immediately seized on the
dominions of that chief.&nbsp; Some variations are told in the
circumstances of this event, but the above I consider as the best
authenticated.</p>
<p>Rana Bahadur, although he could not treat his wife with
kindness, nor even decency, does not seem to have been altogether
unmoved by her noble conduct; and, after his return from Banaras,
had enlarged her father&rsquo;s dominions.&nbsp; Fortunately for
Bhim Sen, the high-spirited lady accompanied the body of her
faithless husband on the funeral pile and freed the new regent
from her presence, which might have been very troublesome.&nbsp;
For his subsequent conduct in seizing on her father&rsquo;s petty
states, which was done when he seized Palpa, it will be difficult
to account, except on the principle of insatiable rapacity.&nbsp;
The tragedies of his first day&rsquo;s government of course
stopped all observations on his conduct.&nbsp; Disliking to have
at the capital a person so venerable, and of such high rank as
Brahma Sahi, he induced that chief to accept the government of
Kumau or Almora, the most honourable in the kingdom, and
augmented in dignity by the new title of Raja Brahma Sahi, exempt
from ambition, and knowing from his character that he was safe
from danger, accepted the office as more suited to his great
years, than the dangerous intrigues of Kathmandu.&nbsp; The
remote government of Saliyana is occupied by his brother
Rudravir, but the youngest brother Hasthadal, and all his
legitimate male issue, are held at Kathmandu, no doubt as
hostages; for all the family is suspected not only <!-- page
262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>of
disaffection, but of being too friendly to the English.&nbsp;
Hasthadal, however, is now one of the Chautariyas.&nbsp; The
command of the army in the west has been continued to Bara Amar
Singha, whose birth gives him no pretension to raise
disturbances; but who has good abilities, and there is reason to
believe is firmly attached to the present ruler.&nbsp; Bhim Sen,
himself, now in the vigour of youth, and of the most determined
courage, has probably very ambitious views.&nbsp; Whether or not
he may think these promoted by his disputes with the English, I
do not know; but the Raja approaches manhood, and the objections
to his succession are very numerous, while the disputes with the
English have been a pretence for assembling a very large force,
(twenty-five companies under the son, and thirteen companies
under the father,) and for thus attaching to his family a very
large proportion of the army.&nbsp; The army in the west is under
the command of Bara Amar Singha, father of Ranadhwar, the chief
confidant and coadjutor of the young minister.</p>
<p>From the following genealogical table of the legitimate
descendants of Narabhupal or Nribhupal, composed in spring 1803,
it will appear, that the line of Prithwi Narayan ended in Rana
Bahadur; nor do I know what has since become of the other
branches of the family.&nbsp; They were in obscurity when the
table was composed, and their condition since has probably in no
way been altered, at least for the better; and at any rate, they
are distant relations to Rana Bahadur, nor are they descended
from Prithwi Narayan, the favourite hero of the nation.&nbsp;
Every male of the family, legitimate or not, takes the title of
Sa, Sahi, or Saha, which is always used in conversation and
writing, but need not be repeated in the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 263--><a

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>There was another family, which contained six petty chiefs,
Gulmi, Khachi, Argha, Musikot, Dhurkot, and Isma; all of whom,
except Musikot, had adopted the rules of purity, and took the
title of Sahi, or Saha, like the chiefs of Gorkha; but it is not
alleged, that the two families had any connection, except by
marriage, and two of the branches of the family, of which I am
now giving an account, Gulmi and Musikot, called themselves Kala
Makwani, although no one knows from whence they came, nor the
origin of the appellation.&nbsp; The Rajas of Gulmi, Khachi, and
Argha, followed Palpa in war; Dhurkot stood independent; and Isma
and Musikot followed Piuthana.</p>
<p>It is probable, that Gulmi was the original seat of the
family, as Khachi and Argha are acknowledged to be collateral
branches; but with the claims of the other three chiefs I am not
acquainted.&nbsp; Gulmi, the capital of the state so named, is
situated on a hill, the ascent of which is said to be three miles
in length.&nbsp; The castle is built of bricks, and covered with
tiles.&nbsp; The town contained 500 houses, mostly
thatched.&nbsp; There is <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>no water
within a quarter of a mile of the town.&nbsp; A part of the great
mart, called Rerighat, mentioned in the account of Palpa,
belonged to the chief of Gulmi.&nbsp; His territory contains
mines of zinc, (dasta,) cinnabar, (sabita,) and copper, of which
one is on a hill, called Chandrakot, and another on Arakul Pahar,
near the former.&nbsp; These mines would appear to be
valuable.&nbsp; The allied chiefs of Palpa, Gulmi, Khachi, and
Argha, as I have mentioned, about the beginning of the eighteenth
century, destroyed the Magar chief of Balihang, and divided among
themselves his dominions, both on the hills and plains.&nbsp; The
division seems to have given rise to sundry bickerings.&nbsp; The
capital, which was situated on a hill near the plains, and
fortified, fell to the share of Palpa; but Gulmi and Khachi
received a large share of the plains.&nbsp; Makunda Sen of Palpa,
about the middle of the last century, contrived to seize on
Gulmi, by the intrigues of a Brahman, named Kanak Nidhi, who
gives me the account, and he delivered the fortress to an officer
of his master&rsquo;s, named Kirtibamb Thapa; but that person
very soon restored the place to its lawful owner.&nbsp; I have
already mentioned the base manner in which Mahadatta of Palpa
joined with his son-in-law, Bahadur Sahi of Gorkha, and how he
obtained Gulmi, Khachi, and Argha, as the dear bought fruit of
his perfidy.&nbsp; These, however, he was allowed to possess, so
long as he lived.&nbsp; Siva Saha, the dethroned chief of Gulmi,
retired to Ramnagar, where he found refuge with the exiled chief
of Tanahung, and while there, gave his grand-daughter in marriage
to Rana Bahadur, the young Raja of Gorkha and Nepal, who no
sooner obtained the government, than he compelled Prithwi Pal to
restore the hills of Gulmi to his wife&rsquo;s father; and when
he returned from Banaras, and had secured Prithwi Pal in
confinement, the original possessions of the Gulmi family were
augmented by the whole <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>of the
hills of Balihang; but this flourishing state lasted only for a
few weeks, as, on the death of Rana and his high-minded spouse,
all her father&rsquo;s possessions were seized by the rapacious
Bhim Sen, who now governs Nepal.&nbsp; Sidhi Pratap, the chief of
Gulmi, is supposed to be still in the mountains; but others
allege, that he has died without issue.&nbsp; He is supposed to
have been about the thirtieth chief of his race.</p>
<p>In Gulmi and Balihang one-half of the people are Khasiyas,
one-eighth Brahmans, of whom many are of pure birth,
(Upadhyayas,) and few illegitimate, (Jausi.)&nbsp; The remainder
of the population consists of impure tribes of cultivators and
artificers.</p>
<p>The principal crop in these hills is the rice, which is reaped
in the beginning of winter, (Aghani.)</p>
<p>The chief of Khachi, a younger branch of Gulmi, profited much
by the spoils of Balihang, and had a fine territory on the plain
adjacent to his hills.&nbsp; In the latter were no mines, except
one of iron; but at the foot of the hills was a considerable
mart, called Barakadwar, the trade of which, however, has been
almost totally forced to Butaul, since the chief of Gorkha has
seized on both countries.&nbsp; It is said, that there is a still
more important pass, called Khor, four coses east from
Barakadwar.&nbsp; This is said to be the easiest of all the
ascents to the mountains, and leads to the town of Khachi, from
whence there are routes in many directions leading to places at a
great distance, without any very difficult ascent or
descent.&nbsp; The town of Khachi, which was the capital, stands
on a hill plentifully supplied with water.&nbsp; The town
contained about 300 houses, mostly thatched; that of the chief
was built of brick.&nbsp; The Raja&rsquo;s share of the land
revenue on the hills, besides the lands for supplying the
officers and soldiers, amounted to 4000 rupees a-year, and from
the plain he annually procured from <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>500 to 1500
rupees, according as the cultivators were discontented or
satisfied.&nbsp; Some of the officers had lands free of rent on
the plains; but, as usual among the mountaineers, the whole
revenue from the plain went to the chief.&nbsp; On the hills of
this state 5-16ths of the people were Khasiyas, Brahmans and
Rajputs 3-16ths, and low cultivators and artisans 8-16ths.&nbsp;
The last Raja&rsquo;s name was Durgar Sahi, who was expelled by
Mahadatta of Palpa, as already mentioned.&nbsp; I have not heard
of his subsequent fate.</p>
<p>Argha belonged also to a collateral branch of Gulmi, which is
supposed by some to have become extinct; but others allege, that
the son of the last chief is now in Nepal.&nbsp; It had a small
territory on the plain, bestowed by Makunda Sen in consequence of
a marriage; but both hill and plain were seized by his son, as I
have mentioned.&nbsp; Argha, the capital, is on a hill, four
coses in ascent, on the summit of which, round the chief&rsquo;s
castle, are about 150 houses, while there are 350 about the
middle of the ascent.&nbsp; The houses have mud walls and
thatched roofs.&nbsp; Water is plenty at the lower town, but is a
quarter of a mile distant from the upper.&nbsp; The hills
possessed no mines, nor any considerable mart.&nbsp; The
Raja&rsquo;s share of the land rent amounted to about 4000 rupees
a-year, and the whole of his territory might contain 5000
houses.&nbsp; Not above 100 of these belonged to Brahmans, and
the number of Rajputs was quite trifling.&nbsp; One half of the
people were Khasiyas, the other half impure cultivators and
tradesmen.</p>
<p>Concerning Dhurkot I learned nothing but what has been already
mentioned, and that its chief had one iron mine.&nbsp; It was
rendered subject to Gorkha by Damodar Pangre.</p>
<p>Musikot was the residence of the chief of this name, who had a
brick-house on a hill close to the Barigar river, and, unlike the
other chiefs of his race, rejected the pure doctrines of <!--
page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>the Brahmans.&nbsp; The house of the chief was
surrounded by 400 houses of his subjects, mostly thatched.&nbsp;
He had no possessions on the plain, and his whole territory might
contain 3000 houses, of which 5-16ths were occupied by Rajputs,
1-16th by Brahmans, mostly of spurious birth, (Jausis,) 4-16ths
by Khasiyas, and 6-16ths by impure cultivators and
tradesmen.&nbsp; Most of the Rajputs were of the Raja&rsquo;s
family, a circumstance uncommon on the hills, where the governing
families seem seldom to have propagated to nearly such an extent,
and were often rather weak.&nbsp; The Raja&rsquo;s share of the
landed revenue was estimated at 2000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; There
was no great mart, but near the Barigar there is a mine of
copper.&nbsp; The great crop here, also, is winter rice.&nbsp;
When Damodar Pangre seized the country, the chief and many of his
family went to Kathmandu, where a great part has obtained
service.</p>
<p>Isma, the last chief of this family, resided at a fortress of
the same name, situated on a lofty hill, of very difficult
access, three coses in ascent.&nbsp; Horses could not ascend more
than half way, where there were about 250 houses.&nbsp; Round the
castle, on the summit, were 50 or 60.&nbsp; These houses are
thatched huts, with walls of stone or planks.&nbsp; On the hill
are several springs of water.&nbsp; The Raja had no possessions
on the plain, and his subjects might amount to 2500 houses, from
whom his share of the rent might amount to 2000 rupees.&nbsp; One
half of his subjects were Khasiyas, 1-8th pure Brahmans,
(Upadhyayas,) 1-16th bastard Brahmans, (Jausis,) 1-16th Rajputs,
and 1-4th low cultivators and tradesmen.&nbsp; The country
contained neither mines nor marts.&nbsp; It must, however, be
observed, that both in this country and in Musikot, Corundum
(Kusan) is found in detached masses, either on the surface or
mixed with the soil.&nbsp; Some of it is bluish like lead, and
some is of a copper colour.&nbsp; The pieces seldom exceed 4lbs.
or 5 lbs. <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>in weight.&nbsp; It affords no
revenue.&nbsp; The chiefs of this family waged a constant war
with their kinsman of Musikot, and the twenty-third or
twenty-fourth of them married a daughter of Makunda Sen of Palpa,
so that Mahadatta leagued with the chief of Gorkha to destroy his
nephew.</p>
<p>The Raja of Piuthana, among these petty chiefs, was a person
of some consequence, and was followed in war by Isma and Musikot,
two chiefs of the last mentioned family.&nbsp; He was also
followed by the chiefs of Khungri and Bhingri, whose countries
were surrounded by Piuthana; and I think, that in all probability
these two belonged to the Chaubisiyas, although they are not
mentioned in Kanak Nidhi&rsquo;s list; and I must confess, that
the latter I have heard arranged with the twenty-two Rajas.&nbsp;
All that I learned concerning these chiefs is, that they were of
the same family, followed Piuthana in war, and were very
petty.&nbsp; The situation of their countries will be seen in the
maps.</p>
<p>Piuthana had no mines of value, but it possessed a
considerable tract on the plain, and paid the revenue of this
through the Raja of Bangsi, after Mahadatta of Palpa had been
freed from that vassalage by the Nawab Vazir.&nbsp; This
territory on the plain, called Siwaraj, is, therefore, claimed by
the Bangsi family; but is in possession of the Raja of
Gorkha.&nbsp; The chief of Piuthana pretends to be a Chandel
Rajput, nor had his family subdivided into different
branches.&nbsp; The town, from whence he derived his title, is
situated on a hill, the ascent to which is two coses in
length.&nbsp; Round their chief&rsquo;s house, which was built of
brick after the fashion of Kathmandu, were about 400 houses,
mostly mud-walled huts with thatched roofs.&nbsp; The Jimri,
called Rapti in the low country, passes on its south side.&nbsp;
The whole territory on the hills and plains contained about 2500
houses, of whom 5-16ths were Khasiyas, 3-16ths Brahmans, one-half
low cultivators and tradesmen.&nbsp; There were a very few <!--
page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>Rajputs and Newars.&nbsp; Manik Chandra possessed this
country in quiet, and was succeeded by Mati Chandra, who retired
without a struggle, when attacked by Damodar Pangre.&nbsp; Rudra
Chandra, his son, now resides at Ramnagar with the Tanahung Raja,
for the people of Gorkha seized on Siwaraj, when they took
possession of Piuthana, although it then belonged to the Nawab
Vazir, and should now form a part of the Gorakhpur
district.&nbsp; They at first cajoled the Bangsi Rajah, promising
to pay more than the chief of Piuthana had done; but, after the
first year, he got nothing.&nbsp; The present representative of
the family, in 1814, was about twenty-eight years of age, and is
supposed to be the twenty-fifth chief of his race.&nbsp; If so,
his pretence to be a Chandel is probably ill-founded, as no true
Rajputs are said to have settled so early in these hills.</p>
<p>Poin was a very petty chief, who followed in war the impure
chief of Bhirkot, but was himself pure, and called himself a
Sirnet, saying that he came from the mountains south-west from
the Yamuna.&nbsp; Poin is situated on a high hill, where much
snow falls, and there is intense cold.&nbsp; At this capital were
only 120 houses, and the whole in the territory amounted to only
2000; but there were iron and copper mines in the country, and
the Raja, for his share of the revenue, had 4000 rupees a
year.</p>
<p>In the list of the twenty-four Rajas given by Kanak Nidhi, a
Tarki Raja is mentioned; but I heard no account of any such
person, nor does any such place appear in the maps.&nbsp; In
place of Tarki I suspect, therefore, we must introduce the very
petty chief of Malihang, usually called the Sat Bisi, or
seven-score Raja, because his revenue amounted to 140 rupees a
year; a poverty which renders St Marino an empire.</p>
<p>There remain two countries, Malebum or Malebamba, and Galkot,
which, by all the authorities that I consulted, were <!-- page
270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>included among the Chaubisiya or twenty-four Rajas,
and, therefore, I shall treat of them here, although I suspect an
inaccuracy.&nbsp; It is said, that there was a certain impure
chief of the Jariya tribe, who had very extensive
dominions.&nbsp; The daughter and heiress of this chief married a
Gautamiya Brahman, and by him had twenty-two sons, each of whom
obtained a share of his grandfather&rsquo;s dominions, and among
these, besides Malebum and Galkot, are the northern Musikot,
Jajarkot, Jahri, Bangphi, Rugun, and Salyana, all reckoned in a
class called the Baisi or twenty-two Rajas.&nbsp; I have not been
able to procure a complete list of these chiefs, some of whose
dominions extend farther north than the knowledge of my
informants; but I think, that the above mentioned circumstance of
the twenty-two descendants of a common origin must have given
rise to the classification, and that Malebum and Galkot in fact
belong to the Baisi, thus making room for Khungri and Bhingri in
the Chaubisiyas, among whom they are placed in the maps.&nbsp;
The same conclusion may be drawn from a circumstance stated of
Nag Bamba of Malebum; who is said in his wars to have led
twenty-two chiefs to battle.</p>
<p>The Brahman common ancestor of this family settled first at
Takam, where his father-in-law probably resided, and this place
is in Malebum, or Parbat, as the country is often called, on
account of the immense mountains that it contains.&nbsp; This
division of the grandfather&rsquo;s estate was always by far the
most powerful, and was probably the share of the eldest
son.&nbsp; The Brahman was named Dimba Ray, which savours rather
of a barbarous race.&nbsp; On his marriage he called himself a
Samal Rajput, and all his descendants have imitated his example,
although, according to the custom of the country, they should be
reckoned Khasiyas, being descended of a Brahman father and impure
mother.&nbsp; I have never before, nor any where else, <!-- page
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>heard of a Gautamiya Brahman; and the Gautamiya tribe
of the plains is a spurious branch of the Gautama Rajputs,
formerly very powerful near Allahabad; and I suspect that Dimba
Ray belonged to this race.</p>
<p>Some generations after the fortunate marriage of this chief,
the seat of government was removed from Takam to Dhoral Thana,
usually called Malebum, and situated at the junction (Beni) of
the Mayangdi, Mehagdi of Kirkpatrick, with the Narayani.&nbsp; On
this account the town is often called Beni Shahar or Beniji,
while Dhoral is the name of the castle by which it is commanded;
Malebum is a term applicable to both.&nbsp; Nag Bamba was then
Raja, and he was a person eminent for strength and courage.&nbsp;
A prize-fighter (Mal) from Dilli, who had previously overcome all
those in three principalities that dared to engage him, was
conquered by Nag Bamba, on which occasion the king (Padshah) sent
him the title of Nag Bamba Mal.&nbsp; This chief and his allies
had afterwards a long continued war with his sovereign lord, the
Raja of Yumila, who wished to possess himself of Thenikot.</p>
<p>Long after this Raja Male Bamba Mal communicated his name to
the principality.&nbsp; His son was Saha Bamba Mal, who was
succeeded by his son Kirti Bamba, reckoned the sixtieth in
descent from Dimba, but more probably from the first of the
barbarian race from whom Dimba procured the country.&nbsp; The
government of Kirti Bamba gave great dissatisfaction to his
officers, who wished to dethrone him, and to place in his stead
his own son Nrisingha Mal, then a child.&nbsp; This gave Bahadur
Saha an opportunity of conquering the country with little
difficulty.&nbsp; The Raja with his son retired to Balirampur, in
the dominions of the Nawab Vazir, where the father shortly died,
and the son, unable to suffer the heat, retired to the hills, and
<!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>lives near Bhirkot on a small allowance from the Raja
of Nepal.</p>
<p>Parbat or Malebum is a very elevated cold country, one-fourth
of the whole being occupied by mountains covered with perpetual
snow.&nbsp; It contains the remarkable hot springs of Muktanath,
with mines of sulphur, cinnabar, iron, and copper, and some
allege of zinc, (Dasta,) although by others this is denied.&nbsp;
The mines of copper are said to be twenty-five in number, and
produce a great revenue, besides what is used in the country and
Thibet, sending large quantities to the plains of India.&nbsp; It
also has three mines of Abrac or mica, and several places abound
in rock crystal, (Phatik.)&nbsp; The crystals are said to be
sometimes found as thick as a man&rsquo;s thigh, but their usual
size is five or six inches in length.&nbsp; Gold also is found in
the sands of several rivers, especially in the Krishna Gandaki or
Narayani, the Bakhugar or Bathugar, the Modi, and the
Mayangdi.</p>
<p>The upper part of the river, which in the plains of India is
called the Gandaki, is called Kali, and, rising near a place
called Damodur kund, runs through the territories of a Bhotiya
chief, called the Mastang Raja, who is, or at least when I saw
him in 1802, was tributary to Gorkha; but there is reason to
think, that since that time the Chinese have compelled the Raja
of Gorkha to cede both Mastang and Kerung.&nbsp; On passing the
highest peaks of Emodus, the Kali enters Malebum, and receives
from the east a small stream called the Narayani, which rises
near the perennial snow from the warm sources of Muktanath, a
very celebrated place of pilgrimage.&nbsp; The usual love of
fable multiplies the number of these sources to 1000; but Sadhu
Ram, who has visited the place, reduces the number to seven, and
the most remarkable is the Agnikund or spring of fire, which is
in a temple.&nbsp; The spring is not <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>remarkably
copious, but is perennial, and issues from among stones,
accompanied by a flame, which rises a few inches.&nbsp; The water
falls immediately into a well (Kund) or cistern, which is about
two feet wide.&nbsp; On the whole, so far as I can understand the
description, it entirely resembles the Sitakunda near Chitagang,
that is, the water has no connexion with a subterraneous fire,
and the flame is occasioned by the burning of an inflammable air,
that issues from the crevices of a rock, over which the water has
been artificially conducted.&nbsp; The streams of the Kali and
Narayani unite at Kagakoti, take the name of Narayani, and are
also called Krishna, Gandaki, and Salagrami, from the number of
stones of that kind, which the channel contains.</p>
<p>Concerning these places Colonel Kirkpatrick states, <a
name="citation273"></a><a href="#footnote273"
class="citation">[273]</a> that four journeys beyond the capital,
is situated Muktanath, within half a mile of which the Gandaki
takes the name of Salagrami.&nbsp; It rises north from Muktanath,
and not far from Kagbeini (Kagakoti) in the direction of Mastang,
a place of some note in Upper Thibet, and twelve days&rsquo;
journey from Malebum.&nbsp; Three days&rsquo; journey beyond
Muktanath is Damodarkund, a celebrated spring or natural
reservoir.&nbsp; The breadth of the Narayani at Beni, the capital
of Malebum, is said not to exceed thirty yards wide.&nbsp;
Colonel Crawford laid down the upper part of this river&rsquo;s
course, from the authority of a Lama, who accompanied the Mastang
Raja, which is better than that received by Colonel
Kirkpatrick.</p>
<p>Thakakuti, some way below Kaga Koti, is the chief mart for the
trade with Thibet through Mastang, and may contain one thousand
houses.&nbsp; The Narayani is no where fordable below <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>this place, and is crossed in some places on wooden
bridges, (Sangga,) and in others on jholas or bridges of ropes
made of rattans connected by cords of tough grass.&nbsp;
Thakakuti is situated in a fine valley extending from Dhumpu to
Kaga Koti, which is compared to the valley of Nepal, but is not
so wide, and the hills around are covered with perennial
snow.&nbsp; The plain is sandy.&nbsp; Danakoti, some way below
Dhumpu, is a place of some trade.&nbsp; There is there a bad
hill, but except over that, oxen could, with some difficulty,
carry loads all the way from Rerighat to Kaga Koti.&nbsp; Goods
are, however, conveyed mostly, if not entirely, on men&rsquo;s
shoulders, or on sheep.&nbsp; Dhorali, the former abode of the
Rajas, with the adjacent town of Beni, is still the most
considerable place in Malebum.&nbsp; Kusma on the Modi, near its
junction with the Narayani, has some commerce, but the great
route of trade goes through the hills straight from Dhorali to
Rerighat, and from thence to Butaul, without at all following the
course of the river.&nbsp; Baglungchaur, according to Colonel
Kirkpatrick, <a name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a> is a large town and fort situated in a
valley, and very opulent and populous.</p>
<p>In the whole country it is supposed, that there are 100,000
families, of whom three-fourths are Gurungs, occupying chiefly
the country west and north from the capital, which is called
Seshant.&nbsp; This country is cultivated with the hoe, and the
crops are, 1. Barley, 2. Uya, which, I presume, is rye, the
natives saying, that it is neither barley nor wheat, but has a
resemblance to both.&nbsp; It must, however, be confessed, that
it may merely be the kind of rice called Uya, which is reared on
the high uneven land, that, in treating of Nepal Proper, I have
mentioned in the account of agriculture; for the natives <!--
page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>speak of the objects of natural history with such a
want of precision, that much reliance cannot be placed on their
comparisons.&nbsp; 3. Maruya, or Eleusine Corocanus, 4. Kanguni,
(<i>Panicum Italicum</i>;) and, 5. Phaphar, said by some to be a
species of Amaranthus, called Amardana in the low country; but
others say that this is a mistake.&nbsp; The other crops are
inconsiderable.&nbsp; The other part of the country, south and
east from the capital, is called Khasant.&nbsp; One half of its
inhabitants are Brahmans, mostly of the bastard (Jausis) race,
who plough and carry burthens; one-fourth consists of Khasiyas,
who call themselves Khatris; and one-fourth consists of other
Hindus of a lower birth, but called also Khasiyas.&nbsp; Very few
of even these spurious Hindus have settled among the Gurungs, and
very few of the latter have remained in the Khasant.&nbsp; The
houses in both parts have in general stone walls, and are
thatched.&nbsp; Some of those belonging to the Gurungs have two
stories.</p>
<p>Galkot, which belonged to a chief of the same family with
Malebum, is a territory of small extent, but contains three mines
of copper, and one of iron, which would be very productive, were
there a sufficient number of miners, (Agari;) but there are only
a few, and these have an exclusive right to work the mines.&nbsp;
Although a cooler country than the valley of Nepal, it is the
best cultivated in these parts, partly with the hoe, partly with
the plough.&nbsp; Except in Malebum, the latter alone is used in
all the territories hitherto described.&nbsp; The Raja&rsquo;s
share of the revenue, including the mines, amounted to 3500
rupees a year.&nbsp; The whole number of inhabitants were
reckoned at 3000 houses, of whom a half were low tribes of
cultivators and tradesmen; one-fourth Khasiyas, and one-fourth
Rajputs and Brahmans.&nbsp; The chief&rsquo;s house called Galkot
was on a hill, the ascent to which is reckoned five coses
long.&nbsp; <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>Around it were 500 houses, mostly
thatched huts.&nbsp; Colonel Kirkpatrick <a
name="citation276"></a><a href="#footnote276"
class="citation">[276]</a> calls Galkot a considerable fort and
town.&nbsp; The Raja, on being attacked by order of Bahadur Saha,
submitted quietly, and remained in the country.</p>
<p>As I have said, these two last chiefs have been included among
the Chaubisiya or twenty-four Rajas, agreeable to the reports I
heard; although I think it probable that they actually belonged
to the Baisi or twenty-two Rajas.</p>
<p>At Rugun resided one of the twenty-two Rajas, whose territory
was adjacent to Malebum on the west; but my informants had very
little knowledge of that part of the country.</p>
<p>West from Rugun is Musikot, the chief of which also is said to
have been one of the twenty-two Rajas.</p>
<p>West again from Musikot is Jajarkot, whose chief also belonged
to the same class, and to the alliance, at the head of which was
the chief of Malebum.</p>
<p>South from Jajarkot is Bangphi, which belonged to another of
the twenty-two Rajas.</p>
<p>In the same direction I heard of Gajal, Dharma, and Jahari,
three petty states also in alliance with Malebum, and probably
belonging to three of the twenty-two Rajas, but that was not
stated.&nbsp; Their situations are not placed in the maps, and
Dharma may perhaps be a tribe of Bhotiyas, that was formerly
subject to Yumila, and bore the name of Dharma.</p>
<p>In the maps again, I observe Satatala among the twenty-two
Rajas; but I procured no verbal account of the place, and its
name implies seven petty districts, so that, in place of being
one petty state, it should have perhaps been marked as seven.</p>
<p>Malaneta is near it, and belonged to a chief of the <!-- page
277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>Malebum family, who lived in strict alliance with the
Raja of Saliyana of the same race.&nbsp; The Malaneta Raja had no
mines nor plain country, and was very poor.</p>
<p>Saliyana is also called Khasant, 10-16ths of its inhabitants
being Khasiyas, or bastards of various kinds, 2-16ths are pure
Brahmans, (Upadhyayas,) 1-16th bastard Brahmans, (Jausis,) and
3-16ths consist of various impure tribes.&nbsp; Saliyana, the
residence of the chief, is situated on a large hill, and his
house was built of brick, and covered with tiles.&nbsp; The other
houses were mostly mud-walled huts.&nbsp; The air there is cool,
although not so cold as Kathmandu.&nbsp; The Raja fortunately
held some part of the plain belonging to the Nawab, and in a
valley, between the mountains and a low ridge of hills, had a
considerable mart called Jara Pani, or cool water, a tempting
name on the burning plains of India.&nbsp; It is ten coses
north-east from Balirampur, and is still a considerable
thoroughfare, although not so great as Butaul.&nbsp; The Raja
possessed also several mines, yet he was so poor, that, when the
late chief married a daughter of Prithwi Narayan&rsquo;s, the
young lady complained bitterly to her father, that he had
bestowed her on a chief unable to give her food.&nbsp; Prithwi
promised to give her the estate of the neighbouring chief of
Dang, but died before this was accomplished.&nbsp; It was,
however, done by Bahadur Saha, the lady&rsquo;s brother, and she
and her two sons enjoyed their estates quietly, until Rana
Bahadur was murdered.&nbsp; Bhim Sen, the present violent ruler,
did not respect the daughter of the favourite hero of his
country; but, when he seized Palpa, seized also on her estates,
carrying her and her younger son to Kathmandu, where he allows
them a very scanty subsistence.&nbsp; The eldest son fled to his
estates on the plain, fortunate in having the protection of the
Nawab Vazir, with whose <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>dominions
the chiefs of Gorkha do not interfere.&nbsp; Why they respect
them more than the Company&rsquo;s, I do not exactly know; but
that they do so is certain.&nbsp; This branch of the Malebum
family is supposed to have governed for about 50 generations.</p>
<p>The Raja of Dang, the next neighbour to Saliyana, has adopted
the rules of purity, and is connected by marriage with the Palpa
family; but, whether he was reckoned one of the twenty-two Rajas,
I have not learned, although, from his situation and family,
being a Samal, that is, of the Malebum race, I think it highly
probable.&nbsp; By Colonel Kirkpatrick, however, as I have
already mentioned, he and the next chief of his family are both
classed among the twenty-four Rajas.&nbsp; The chiefs formerly
lived on a high hill called Dang; and, until deprived of this
part of their estate, they had there a house called Chaugora; but
for some generations they had withdrawn to Phalabamb, which was
not on the plain, but on a hill immediately overhanging it.&nbsp;
This town is now often called Dang, and consists of huts with mud
or wooden walls, the Raja&rsquo;s house alone being built of
brick.&nbsp; On the hills were several mines of iron; but the
most valuable part of the chief&rsquo;s estate was on the plain,
and consists of Pergunah Tulasipur, belonging to the Nawab
Vazir.&nbsp; A part of this, called the Bhitari Tarai, is
separated from the great plain of India by a small ridge of
hills.&nbsp; The valley between this small ridge and the
mountains is about six coses wide, and belongs partly to
Saliyana, partly to Dang.&nbsp; I have already mentioned, that
Bahadur Saha took the hills of Dang, and gave them to his sister,
the Rani of Saliyana, but New Dang, or Phalabamb, was protected
by the Nawab Vazir.&nbsp; Nawab Singha, who was deprived of his
estates, was reckoned the fortieth chief of his race.&nbsp; He
retired to a house called Barapate, twelve coses north from
Tulasipur, and he usually resided <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>there,
although he had a house at Tulasipur.&nbsp; His son Dana Bahadur
is now Raja of Tulasipur, and is said to have about 25,000
families of vassals.&nbsp; Among these are a few Upadhyayas,
Jausis, and Khasiyas near Phalabamb; but the most numerous casts
are Brahmas, Puns, and Ales, all impure: there are a good many
Majhis and Darwes, both pure, and some Ghartis, partly Misal and
partly Bhujal, both impure.&nbsp; Some Ghartis, who are pure, are
called Khasiyas.</p>
<p>Chilli is a very small territory, partly on the plains and
partly on the hills; but it produced, as the Raja&rsquo;s share,
2500 rupees a-year.&nbsp; The chief&rsquo;s residence was on a
hill, the ascent to which may be 1&frac12; cose in length.&nbsp;
There is round his house a small town containing two hundred
houses.&nbsp; He is of the Samal tribe, that is, of the Malebum
family, and is a branch of the Dang chief&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
Being nearly connected with the Gorkha family by marriage, when
his estates were seized, he went to Kathmandu, and procured the
whole to be restored without even tribute.&nbsp; If Bhim Sen has
respected them, he is the only chief from the Tista to the
Yamuna, that has retained his estates or power.</p>
<p>According to my ideas, Malebum, Galkot, Rugun, Musikot,
Jajarkot, Bangphi, Gajal, Dharma, Jahari, Satatala, Malaneta,
Saliyana, Dang, and Chilli, are fourteen of the twenty-two
chiefs, so that there are still eight wanting; but Satatala,
implying seven petty divisions, may account for six of these, and
the two remaining may be Dalu Dailek, or Bilaspur and Duti,
although I did not hear any such thing mentioned, and neither
Raja is of the Malebum family.</p>
<p>By Colonel Kirkpatrick <a name="citation279"></a><a
href="#footnote279" class="citation">[279]</a> the twenty-two
Rajas are called <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>Bansi, no doubt by an error of the
editor for Baessi, or twenty-two.&nbsp; Unfortunately the list,
which he procured, is as imperfect as mine, and is as
follows.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Jumla, (Yumila,) 2.&nbsp; Jajurkote, (Jajarkot,)
3.&nbsp; Cham, 4.&nbsp; Acham, 5.&nbsp; Roogum, (Rugun,) 6.&nbsp;
Musikote 2d, (Musikot,) 7.&nbsp; Roalpa, 8.&nbsp; Mullyanta,
(Malaneta,) 9.&nbsp; Bulhang, (Balihang,) 10.&nbsp; Dylick, (Dulu
Dailek,) 11.&nbsp; Suliana 2d, (Saliyana,) 12.&nbsp; Bamphi,
(Bangphi,) 13.&nbsp; Jehari, (Jahari,) 14.&nbsp; Kalagong,
15.&nbsp; Ghoorikote, 16.&nbsp; Gootum, 17.&nbsp; Gujoor,
(Gajal?) 18.&nbsp; Darimeea, (Dharma.)</p>
<p>Of these the 1st, so far as I could learn, belonged to neither
the twenty-four nor the twenty-two Rajas, but to the common chief
of both classes, and the 9th, according to the information which
I received, belonged to the class containing twenty-four
chiefs.&nbsp; The 10th number confirms my conjecture concerning
Dalu Dailek being one of the twenty-two chiefs.&nbsp; No. 3, 4,
7, 14, 15, and 16, are probably six of the seven chiefs, which in
my list were included under the common name Satatala.&nbsp; Or if
Satatala be considered as the proper name of one territory, the
above-mentioned places would serve to complete the list.&nbsp; I
have heard nothing myself concerning these places, and can find
almost nothing in Colonel Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; From a
route, however, which he gives, <a name="citation280"></a><a
href="#footnote280" class="citation">[280]</a> it would appear
that Chhamkote, probably the capital of Cham, is about thirty one
miles road distance west from the Karnali river, (Kurnali Kola,)
and that Acham is thirty-two miles farther west.&nbsp; Both
territories are west from Yumila, and in the route are said to
have belonged to its chief.&nbsp; Acham he reckons seventy-two B.
miles in a straight line from Duti, (Dhotee,) and about
twenty-four from Yumila, four miles road distance, on long
routes, giving only one in a direct line.</p>
<p><!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>The country between the Beni and Dalu Basandra, by
Sadhu Ram, was called Bilaspur, while by the two Nidhis it was
called Dalu Dailek, a name which should be preferred, as farther
west there is another Bilaspur.&nbsp; The chief town is at
Mathagari, where the government of Nepal, since the conquest, has
built a fort.&nbsp; It is probable that Mathagari is the name of
this fort, and that the former town was called Bilaspur, but I
did not hear this mentioned.&nbsp; This capital contains about
one hundred and fifty thatched huts.&nbsp; The chief&rsquo;s
house is built of stone, and partly thatched, partly covered with
tiles.&nbsp; The chief was called a Khas, but he rejected the
rules of Hindu purity, and was probably one of the real ancient
Khasiyas.&nbsp; When attacked by the forces of Bahadur Saha, he
retired to some strongholds and began to plunder, on which all
persons of his family that could be caught were put to
death.&nbsp; This so terrified the chief that he fled; but to
what place my informants do not know.&nbsp; There are in the
country many Khasiyas, who, I presume, live impure like their
former master.&nbsp; There were scarcely any pure Brahmans
(Upadhyayas) in the country; but about one-eighth of the people
were considered pure, and were called Jausis and Rajputs.&nbsp;
The most remarkable thing, by far, in this petty territory is the
place of worship called Dalu Basandra.&nbsp; There are three
springs (Kunds) supposed to issue from the head, navel, and feet
of Vishnu, (Sirasthan, Nabhisthan, and Padukasthan.)&nbsp; The
central one is about 1&frac12; cose from each of the extreme
springs.&nbsp; At each place, according to Sadhu Ram, who once
performed the pilgrimage, there is a small natural pool without
any building.&nbsp; The water springs from the sand in the
bottoms of the pools, and is very hot.&nbsp; Above the small
holes from whence the water issues, of which there are several in
each pool, a flame appears on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>West from Dalu Basandra was rather a considerable chief, <!--
page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>called the Duti Raja, who, according to Prati Nidhi,
pretended to be of the family of the Sun; but, according to
Hariballabh, the chiefs of this state were of a collateral branch
of the Shalivahan family.&nbsp; According to Prati Nidhi, they
had governed for about 40 generations, when Vishnu Sa, the son of
Pradipa Sa, was dethroned by order of Bahadur Sahi.&nbsp; He was
carried to Nepal, but Prati does not know what has been his
fate.&nbsp; According, however, to Hariballabh, the chief who was
expelled was Dip Sa, the son of Krishna Sa, the son of Mahendra
Sa.&nbsp; He resided some years at Pilibhit, where he died,
leaving three sons, who have retired to Mahmudi, in the
Nawab&rsquo;s country, in great distress, the army of Gorkha
having seized the whole of their lands on the plains, as well as
on the mountains.&nbsp; I have, however, heard it stated, that
very lately the heir has been taken into favour, and restored to
his estates, on condition of paying an annual tribute.&nbsp; The
country extended to the Kali-nadi, or Black-water, which
separated it from Kumau, and through its centre passes the
Setigangga, or White River.&nbsp; On the banks of this is a fine
valley, two coses long and one broad, in which stands Dipal, the
capital, surrounded on three sides by the river.&nbsp; It
contains about 400 houses built of stone, and roofed with the
same material.&nbsp; The Rajas possessed some territory on the
plains.&nbsp; Of the whole population, pure (Upadhyayas) Brahmans
composed a fourth, the bastard Jausis an equal share, Khasiyas
3-16ths, and low labourers and tradesmen 5-16ths.&nbsp; The
principal crop was winter rice, the second Urid, the third
Kurthi, and the fourth barley; all the others were small.&nbsp;
The oil-seed chiefly reared was the Til, or Sesamum.</p>
<p>To the north of all these petty chiefs, and reaching within
two days&rsquo; journey of Dipal and Mathagari, is an extensive
country called Yumila, which, towards the west, was once bounded
<!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>by the territory of Gar, or Garhawal, the capital of
which is Srinagar; and towards the east by Mastang, as it
extended to Kagakoti on the Narayani, at the northern extremity
of Malebum; but towards the east it was much straitened by
Jajarkot, which extends to within a few coses of Chhinachhin, the
capital.&nbsp; Large territories also had been gradually seized
from its prince, by the chief of Kumau, who had extended his
dominions to the snowy mountains.</p>
<p>The chief of Yumila was a Rajput, and he was long acknowledged
as the supreme lord or king over all the mountain chiefs towards
the west; at least, as all my informants from that quarter
declared, and they extended his authority to the east also; but
this was entirely denied by Hariballabh, and in these parts his
information is more to be trusted than that of the others.&nbsp;
We may safely, however, conclude, that his superiority was
acknowledged everywhere between the Kali river and Nepal.&nbsp;
His authority, however, was still more limited than that of the
late C&aelig;sars of Germany, his subjects frequently levying
war, not only against each other, but against their sovereign;
nor was there any assembly of states from which he could obtain
assistance against a common enemy.&nbsp; His power probably
resembled that possessed by those who were called the sovereign
kings of India, before the Muhammedan conquest, and consisted in
three privileges.&nbsp; Each chief sent him an annual embassy,
with presents; he bestowed the mark of royalty (Tika) on each
heir, when he succeeded; and he had a right to interfere in
keeping the stronger from overrunning the weaker; and to exhort
all chiefs to preserve the balance of power.&nbsp; Except
persuasion, however, no means seem to have existed to enforce
co-operation.&nbsp; Still, however, the evident common benefit of
such a power seems long to have given it some effect; although,
in the struggle for universal dominion by the chiefs <!-- page
284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>of
Gorkha, it never seems on any one occasion to have been
employed.</p>
<p>Etawargiri is a merchant nominally dedicated to religion,
(Atithi,) who was born at Chhinachhin, and who still adheres to
the Raja.&nbsp; He left the country when very young, but has
since made three journeys thither to purchase horses, there being
at the place several merchants of this order, who deal to a
considerable amount.&nbsp; They carry up metals, spices, and
cloths; and bring down cow tails, salt, horses, a woollen cloth
called Pheruya, medicinal herbs, musk, etc.</p>
<p>Etawargiri, setting out from Tulasipur, in the dominions of
the Vazir, crossed the Bheri, and proceeded through Jajarkot, the
territory of which reaches within three coses of Chhinachhin; but
from Jajarkot to the boundary took him nine days over a hilly
country.&nbsp; At the boundary he entered a fine plain cut with
deep ravines, like that of Nepal, but well cultivated.&nbsp; It
is said to extend eight coses from north to south, and fifteen
from east to west.&nbsp; It is cultivated by the plough drawn by
oxen, and produces much wheat, barley, <i>phaphar</i>, and
<i>uya</i>; with some <i>urid</i>, peas, lentiles, and maize, and
a little transplanted rice.&nbsp; Sugar-cane, <i>kodo</i>,
(<i>Paspalum frumentaceum</i>, Roxb.) and <i>chana</i>, (<i>Cicer
arietinum</i>, Lin.) will not grow there, for there is snow in
winter.&nbsp; In this level part of the country, each ploughgate
of land is said to pay ten rupees a-year; but in the high poor
parts of Yumila, one rupee is the rent.</p>
<p>According to the accounts which Colonel Kirkpatrick received,
<a name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a> this valley is nearly of the same
extent as that of Nepal, but is rather more contiguous to the
Himaliya mountains, and more chequered with low hills.&nbsp; The
ridge of mountains immediately to the north is called Seela
pahar, (Sweta pahar, white mountain,) and makes part of the
greater Himaliya.</p>
<p><!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>Chhinachhin is a large scattered place.&nbsp; All the
houses are built of brick or stone, and have flat roofs.&nbsp;
The two most remarkable temples at Chhinachhin, at least in the
opinion of Etawargiri, belong, of course, to Siva.&nbsp; The one
is called Chandranath, the other Bhairav&rsquo;nath.&nbsp; In the
daily market are exposed for sale the birds called Manal and
Dhangphiya, mentioned above, (page 95,) and another called
Chakuri, which I do not know, unless it be the Chakor, mentioned
in page 95.&nbsp; These are commonly eaten.&nbsp; There are also
exposed for sale many sheep and goats, loaded with salt, musk,
medicinal herbs, and a seed called Bariyalbhera.&nbsp; Near
Chhinachhin there are some of the cattle whose tails form the
chaungri <a name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a> chamar, or changwari, of the vulgar
tongue, and the chamari of the Sangskrita, and they are very
numerous in the hilly parts.&nbsp; Sadhu Ram says, that in Bhot
there are three kinds of cow; the Changwari, the Lulu, and the
Jhogo.&nbsp; The tails of all the kinds are bushy from the root,
but those of the changwari are the most valuable.&nbsp; None of
these kinds of cattle have the undulated dew-lap of the Indian
cattle.</p>
<p>Besides the plain on which Chhinachhin is built, the Rajas
held a very great extent of narrow vallies and mountains, many of
the latter perpetually covered with snow.&nbsp; Towards the east,
the country extended fifteen days&rsquo; journey to Bhot.&nbsp; I
know from other circumstances, that it reached to Kagakoti on the
Narayani, which is said to be about nineteen miles east from
Butaul, and Chhinachhin is nearly north from Dalu Basandra,
which, according to the map that I procured, is 124 miles west
from Butaul; the fifteen days&rsquo; journey gives, therefore,
143 miles direct distance, or about 9&frac12; miles for
each.&nbsp; Chhinachhin, at this rate, allowing it to be six
miles from the boundary, <!-- page 286--><a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>would be
about ninety miles north from Jajarkot, which is nearly north
from Dalubasandra, and Jajarkot, according to the map deposited
in the India House, is 108 miles from the plains of India.&nbsp;
But to admit these situations as accurate, we must suppose, that
the snowy mountains take there a great bend to the north, which
is not said to be the case, and we must, therefore, allow that
Jajarkot stands much farther south than it is placed in the map;
and that Yumila is much nearer Jajarkot than Etawargiri
supposes.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick gives a route from Beni, the capital of
Malebum, to Chhinachhin, the two places lying east and west,
distant by the road 250 coses.&nbsp; Their actual distance, by
the native maps, being about 143 miles, will give, on a long
route, rather more than half a mile (0.57) of direct horizontal
distance for the cose of road distance.</p>
<p>One of the most important productions of Yumila is salt, which
is said to come from a place called Mukhola, reckoned ninety or a
hundred miles road distance from Chhinachhin, towards the
north-east.&nbsp; It is said, that, at Mukhola, there is a large
space, containing many pools, that in winter are covered with
snow.&nbsp; When this melts in spring, the water is thrown out,
and cattle arc turned into the muddy pools to tread the bottom
with their feet.&nbsp; As summer advances, a crust of salt is
formed, and removed.&nbsp; I do not understand the nature of such
a process, and suspect some mistake, as the dialect spoken by
Etawargiri was not clearly understood by any of my people, much
less by myself.</p>
<p>About half way between Chhinachhin and Mukhtanath is a
frontier fortress of Yumila called Tibrikot.&nbsp; It is
remarkable for a temple of the goddess Tibrisundari.</p>
<p>About one-fourth of the people in this country are Brahmans,
Rajputs, and Khasiyas, who follow the doctrines of the <!-- page
287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>present Hindu law.&nbsp; The Bhotiyas are on the whole
the most numerous tribe, and with Gurungs, Rohanis, Khatis, and
Rahals, all impure mountain tribes, make up the remaining
three-fourths, who chiefly adhere to the Lamas.&nbsp; The
language spoken at Court was the Khas, but differed very much
from that of Palpa or Gorkha; even the titles of the chief
officers of government were totally different, although the same
forms of administration were established.&nbsp; For instance, the
Chautariya of Palpa was in Chhinachhin called Hitan, and the
Karyi of the former was the Bist of the latter.</p>
<p>According to Hariballabh the Rajas of Yumila were of the
Suryabangsi tribe, and were admitted to be pure, so as to
intermarry with the chiefs of Kumau and Garhawal.&nbsp; They had
penetrated into the northern hills about 500 years ago; but, as I
have above mentioned, were far from having expelled or persecuted
the ancient inhabitants.&nbsp; It was said by the Mahanta of the
Janmasthan at Ayodhya, that they first settled in the Almora
country, and thence removed to Yumila; and as the Duti Raja,
acknowledged to be of the Shalivahan family, is also called a
Suryabangsi, I think it probable, that the Rajas of Yumila are
the descendants and representatives of Asanti and Basanti, and
this will explain the vassalage to them, which all the eastern
chiefs avowed, although the people of Kumau, by whom the Yumila
chiefs were stript of the best part of their dominions, deny this
vassalage, and pretend to knew nothing of their descent.</p>
<p>When Rana Bahadur attacked the country, it is universally
admitted, that he was opposed by Sobhan Sahi; but, according to
Etawargiri, this person was Raja, while Kanak Nidhi says that he
was the Raja&rsquo;s brother, and Hariballabh alleges that that
he was the uncle of the chief.&nbsp; For two years he resisted
the troops of Gorkha, and had collected a force of 22,000 men;
<!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>but Rana Bahadur, watching a favourable opportunity
when most of these had retired to their homes, completely
surprised the country, and acted with such vigour and cruelty,
that no force durst afterwards assemble.&nbsp; A son of Sobhan,
named Munsur Sahi, has fled for protection to the Taolakhar or
Taklakhar Bhotiyas, and Hariballabh says, that the old chief is
now at Lasa.&nbsp; He also says, that the Raja was carried to
Kathmandu, where he died after some confinement.&nbsp; He was not
used harshly, and was allowed two rupees a-day for his
subsistence.&nbsp; A son of the Yumila chief, and acknowledged as
the heir of the family, but whether son or nephew of Sobhan Sahi,
I do not know, lives at Tulasipur, in the Vazir&rsquo;s country,
along with the Dang Raja, his former vassal.</p>
<p>Yumila on the north is bounded by the great snowy ridge called
there Humla, by which it is separated from the country of the
Taolakhar or Taklakhar Bhotiyas, now certainly subject to China,
and in the map of Hariballabh their capital is called
Taklakot.</p>
<p>Near Taklakot, between two parallel ridges of Emodus covered
with everlasting snow, Hariballabh places two lakes, Manasa
Sarawar Vulgo Manasarawar, and Ravanhrad, which receives the
water flowing from the former.&nbsp; On their west side is a vast
peak named Kailasa, which the Hindus suppose to be the residence
of the Gods.&nbsp; The valley, east and west from the lakes, and
extending to a great width between the two ridges of the snowy
mountains, is deeply covered with snow in winter, and then the
shepherds retire lower down; but in summer it is covered with
flocks, the pasture being short, close, and rich.&nbsp; A river
flows from each end of the Ravanhrad, or rather from each
lake.&nbsp; That going to the west is called the Satadru and
Satrudra, and turning to the south forms what we call the
Sutluj.&nbsp; It must, however, be observed, <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>that,
according to Hariballabh, there rises from the northern ridge of
that eastern part of the valley another river, which, as in the
Chinese map of Thibet published in Duhalde, runs west parallel to
the Satrudra.&nbsp; Hariballabh does not know its name.&nbsp; It
was called to him the river of Ladak, as passing that city.&nbsp;
From many other persons I have learned, that this river of Ladak
passes north from Kasmira; and, if not the chief branch, is at
least one of the greatest of those which form the Indus.</p>
<p>The river that flows to the east from the lakes is named the
Karanali, and, according to Hariballabh, who has seen this part
of its course, after flowing a short way in that direction,
passes through the southern ridge of snowy mountains, and waters
Yumila; but he does not know that part of its course, and has
only heard that it passes on the west side of Dalu
Basandra.&nbsp; Kanak Nidhi calls the river thus passing Dalu
Basandra, the Sonabhadra; but Sadhu Ram told me, that its name is
the Karanali, or Salasu, for many rivers of these parts have a
variety of appellations, that is very perplexing to the
geographer.&nbsp; He says, that west from Dalu Basandra, it is a
river as wide as the Gandaki, where that river comes into the
plain, which I have formerly described.&nbsp; Etawargiri says,
that the Karanali passes near the salt mines of Yumila, and then
turns west, passing north from Chhinachhin, in which case it must
take a very large bend to the east from Ravanhrad, and then
another to the west, before it reaches Dalu Basandra.</p>
<p>As connected by trade with Yumila, I may here mention, that
the Chinese, in the, part of Thibet, north-east from Manasarawar,
and beyond the second range of Emodus, have a very valuable gold
mine.&nbsp; It can only be wrought in summer, and those who wish
to mine pay seven Mashes of gold for every <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>solid cubit
of mineral that they dig.&nbsp; They also give to the government
all pieces of gold which they find that weigh more than three
Mashas; all the smaller bits they keep to themselves.&nbsp;
Thirteen Mashas are equal to a Furrokhabad rupee, that is, each
contains between thirteen and fourteen grains.</p>

<span class="smcap">of the countries west from the river
kali</span>.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Kumau; History, State.&mdash;Garhawal;
History, State.&mdash;Sirmaur.&mdash;Twelve
Lordships.&mdash;Besar.&mdash;Hanur.</p>
<p>Kumau is a very considerable territory bordering with Duti on
the east, the boundary being the Kali Nadi.&nbsp; On the west it
has Garhawal or Gar, and it extends a considerable way into the
plains of Bareli; but all that it has there is subject to the
Company.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed, that the founder of the family of
Kumau was Thor Chandra, a needy, but high born descendant of the
family of the Moon, who, about 350 years ago, left Jhausi or
Pratishthan, opposite to Allahabad, in quest of fortune.&nbsp; He
was accompanied by a pure Brahman, equally necessitous, and named
Jaydev, from whom the two Nidhis, my informants, claim a
descent.&nbsp; According to Hariballabh, the two adventurers
agreed that they should repair to the hills, and endeavour to
procure service.&nbsp; If they succeeded, they should by degrees
invite some comrades, and by their assistance, they expected to
overpower their master, and seize his dominions, which were to be
equally divided.&nbsp; They accordingly found service from an
impure chief of the Jar or Magar cast, it is not worth while
investigating which, my informant considering both equally
vile.&nbsp; This fellow had a small territory, for which he paid
tribute in peace to the Rajas of Karuvirpur; who, although of
<!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>pure and high extraction, scandalously suffered their
subjects to wallow in abomination.&nbsp; Having secured this
man&rsquo;s favour, and invited some pure men like themselves,
the two servants cut off their master, expelled the monsters his
subjects, and settled the country with pure Hindus, building the
town of Champawati, or Kurmachal, as it is called in the language
of the Gods; but the word in the language of men has somehow been
corrupted into Kumau.</p>
<p>The soldier, when not actuated by zeal for purity, was an
honourable man; and, no sooner had he acquired this territory,
than he offered the half of it to the priest; but Jaydev declined
the troublesome office of government, and contented himself with
stipulating for the hereditary office of register (Kanungo) and
steward (Zemindar) for all the estates, which the prowess of the
Rajas might acquire.&nbsp; Thor Chandra was succeeded by his son
Kamir C., whose son, Nirbhaga C., having died without legitimate
heirs, the chief officers sent to Jhausi, and procured as a chief
another needy descendant of the Moon.&nbsp; His whole revenues
amounted to about 3000 rupees a-year, and like his predecessors,
pure and impure he paid tribute to the Rajas of Karuvirpur.</p>
<p>In this state the family continued, until the time of Bala
Kalyan C., son of Kirti C., son of Bhishma C., son of Guru Gyangn
C.&nbsp; This Kalyan married a daughter of the Raja of Duti, a
collateral branch of the Karuvirpur family, and by her obtained
Sor, as an addition to his inheritance.&nbsp; Their son, Rudra
C., was a man of great abilities.&nbsp; In his time the family of
his sovereign, the Karuvirpur king, was involved in dissensions,
twenty competitors claiming the succession.&nbsp; Rudra, having a
high character, was chosen by these unfortunate chiefs as umpire;
and entered the capital under pretence of investigating their
claims.&nbsp; When in full possession, he <!-- page 293--><a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>declared
that they were all low fellows, descended only of Shalivahan,
while he was a descendant of the illustrious Budha, and,
therefore, seized on the sovereignty, giving each competitor a
little land in a place called Manur in the Pergunah of Pali,
where their descendants still remain, and are called Manuriya
Rajputs.&nbsp; Rudra now built Almora, and made it the seat of
his extended government.&nbsp; This was in the time of the Mogul
Akbur, one of whose officers, having attacked Almora, was
defeated, and Rudra advancing into the plain, obtained a jaygir
eighty coses long and five wide, then overgrown with woods.&nbsp;
The intelligent chief, however, brought inhabitants, and settled
six Pergunahs, Rudrapur, Sabna, Belahari, Nanakamata, Kasipur,
and Reher, which produced a revenue of 1,000,000 rupees; and in
the first mentioned Pergunah he built a fort of the same
name.&nbsp; He afterwards became a favourite of the kings, who
granted him permission to coin money in the royal name, and
Persian character.&nbsp; No other hill chief had a mint except
Nepal, the Rajas of which have always coined money in their own
name, and in the Nagri character.&nbsp; Rudra finally took
Siragar from his kinsman the Raja of Duti, for he was one of
those great men that do not hesitate about trifles.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his son Lakshmi, who was a saint, and had four
sons.&nbsp; The three eldest, Dilip C., Vijay C. and Trimala C.
succeeded each other, and had no male issue.&nbsp; Nila Singha,
the youngest brother, left a son, Baz Bahadur, who succeeded his
uncle Trimala, and was another man of great activity.&nbsp; He
attacked the Yumila Raja, who after the overthrow of Karuvirpur,
was probably the proper representative of Asanti, and who was
acknowledged as liege lord by all the chiefs of the
mountains.&nbsp; From this prince Baz Bahadur took Danpur, Joyar,
and Dharma.&nbsp; Joyar was a very large territory, including
Baropathi and <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>Munsiyari; and both it and Dharma,
like the other territories of Yumila, were chiefly inhabited by
Bhotiyas, and other impure monsters, who, on the conquest, were
totally expelled or destroyed, and the rules of purity
established.&nbsp; Jagat C., son of Gyangn C., son of Udyot C.,
the son of this Baz Bahadur, was, like his great-grandfather, a
conqueror, and took Chaudas from Yumila, after which the family
began to decline.&nbsp; His son, Devi C., had a dispute with
Muhammed Shah, which was amicably settled by means of Raja Jaya
Singha.&nbsp; He had no son, and was succeeded by Kalyan C. his
grand-uncle, the youngest son of Udyata C.&nbsp; This old man was
succeeded by his son Dip, who had the misfortune to be born dumb,
and to give himself entirely up to religious exercises, leaving
the whole management of his affairs to his wife and
officers.&nbsp; His first favourite was Jaya Krishna, a Brahman
descended of Jaya Deva, the companion of Thor Chandra.&nbsp; This
person, by the intrigues of the queen, (Rani,) was displaced, and
the power transferred to Mohan Singha, a person of the
chief&rsquo;s family, who was in command of the army.&nbsp; He
soon displeased the lady, and, being a man of ungovernable
passions, he retired to Dundiyu Khan, a Rohilla chief; and,
having procured some assistance, returned and put the lady to
death.&nbsp; Jaya Krishna now applied to Hafez, another chief of
the Rohillas, who gave him some men, with whom he put Mohan to
flight.&nbsp; This chief retired to Lakhnau, and watched there,
until he learned that Jaya Krishna was employed in collecting the
revenues of the country.&nbsp; He then, with a small band,
advanced suddenly, and privately seized Almora, and, having sent
the poor creature Dip, and his four sons, to the fortified hill
of Siragar, he declared himself Raja, and, as usual, took the
title of Chandra.&nbsp; His first care was to inveigle Jaya
Krishna into his power, which he did by numerous assurances of
friendship, and offers <!-- page 295--><a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>of
employment.&nbsp; The Brahman was outwitted, and went into the
castle of Kotaghat, where, as he advanced to embrace the Raja,
who stood with open arms, a soldier struck off his head.&nbsp;
Mohan then imprisoned Harsha Dev, the brother of Jaya Krishna;
and, thinking himself firmly established, ordered Dip and his
four sons to be thrown over the castle wall, which was done, and
they were dashed to pieces.&nbsp; Jaya Deva, however, an uncle of
Harsha Dev, went to Lalit Sa, Raja of Garhawal, and, having
obtained 4000 men from him, drove out Mohan C.; but could not
release his nephew, who being very warlike, was considered as of
great importance, and was carried off by Mohan; soon after,
however, he contrived to escape.&nbsp; The uncle and nephew then
conferred the government on Pradyumna Sa, a younger son of their
benefactor, the Raja of Garhawal, who took the title of Chandra,
while the uncle was appointed (Nayeb) chief civil minister, and
the nephew commander of the forces, (Bukhshi.)&nbsp; On the death
of his father, Pradyumna, during three years, disputed for the
succession of Garhawal with his elder brother Jayakirti; but
without success.&nbsp; The elder brother, then dying without male
issue, Pradyumna became undisputed owner of Garhawal and
Kumau.&nbsp; He had a younger brother named Parakrama, of a very
intriguing disposition, who, having been gained by Mohan Chandra,
persuaded Pradyumna to dismiss Harsha Dev, who retired to the low
country; and Kumau, being entrusted to weak hands, was recovered
by Mohan Chandra, who held it for sixteen months.&nbsp; Harsha
Dev&rsquo; could no longer suffer this, but attacked his enemy,
and, having taken him and his son prisoners, he put them both to
death.&nbsp; In this he vented his hatred on the father by a
barbarous refinement of cruelty.&nbsp; Under pretence of not
shedding royal blood, he kept his unfortunate rival without food,
and daily beat him, until he expired.&nbsp; It is <!-- page
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>said that he suffered for seventeen days, but this
seems incredible.&nbsp; The Brahman then placed on the throne a
certain Siva Chandra, who was alleged to be of the family of
Kumau, and acted as his chief minister.&nbsp; About this time the
forces of Golam Kader having been dispersed by the Mahrattas,
many of them were engaged by Lal Singha, whom some call the son,
and others the brother of Mohan Chandra.&nbsp; With these troops
this chief drove out Harsha, who fled to Garhawal.&nbsp; He there
entered into an alliance with Parakrama, the Raja&rsquo;s
brother, his former enemy, and both attacked and defeated Lal
Singha, who had advanced into Garhawal to meet them.&nbsp; He was
driven into Almora, where he contrived to form a treaty with
Parakrama, by which Mahendra, the son of Mohan, was made Raja,
and Harsha was placed in confinement.&nbsp; From this, however,
he soon contrived to escape, and retired to the plains.&nbsp;
Siva Chandra was allowed to escape, as having been a mere tool in
the hands of the Brahman.&nbsp; In this state were affairs, when
Damodar Pangre, the officer commanding the troops of Gorkha, sent
his brother Jagajit and Amar Singha Thapa to attack the
country.&nbsp; They were joined by Harsha Dev&rsquo;, and met
with very little resistance.&nbsp; Lal Singha and Mahendra
Chandra the Raja retired to Rudrapur, where Mahendra died,
leaving a son named Pratap Singha.&nbsp; Their valuable estates
in the low country are in the Company&rsquo;s possession, nor has
it been determined to whom they will be given; for there are
several competitors.&nbsp; Pratap claims as heir to the family,
but his father was an usurper, although it would appear, that all
other more direct lines of the family have now failed.&nbsp;
Harsha claims as heir of Jaydev, who, by the agreement with Thor
Chandra, should be Zemindar (collector) and Kanungoe (register)
for the whole, availing himself of the interpretation, which has
been given in our courts to the term Zemindar, (landlord.)&nbsp;
The widow of <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>Siva Lal claims, as her husband,

was ceded by the Nawab.&nbsp; The widow of Lal Singha and Siva
Lal are allowed pensions.</p>
<p>Almora on the Soyal contains, according to all accounts, about
1000 houses.&nbsp; According to Hariballabh, it is situated on
the narrow ridge of a hill abounding in fine springs of
water.&nbsp; Champawati, the ancient capital, called Kurmachal in
the Sangskrita, may contain 200 or 300 houses, and is cooler than
Almora.&nbsp; The only other towns are Ganggoli and Pali, each
containing about 100 houses.&nbsp; In these towns the houses are
built and roofed with stone, and several are two or three stories
high.&nbsp; The population of the hills was estimated by Prati
Nidhi at 50,000 families.&nbsp; All the impure tribes had been
destroyed, except a very few Jars and Magars in Baropathi, that
had been lately taken from Yumila, under which government these
people enjoyed full toleration.&nbsp; The Brahmans are not
numerous, all living a pure life, and abstaining from intercourse
with the low tribes.&nbsp; The Rajputs form the most numerous
class, but all, who are poor, except the descendants of
Shalivahan, hold the plough.&nbsp; The Sudra tribes of
cultivators are Ahir, Jat, Lodi, and Chauhan.&nbsp; Near Agra the
Jats by other casts are reckoned the same with Ahirs; although,
being there powerful, in their own territories they call
themselves Rajputs.&nbsp; In the mountains they are considered as
mere Sudras, and different from the Ahirs, an undoubted tribe of
the plains, as are the Lodi; but I suspect, that the Jats and
Chauhans of the mountains are original tribes converted to Hindu
purity; for one of the Chauhan chiefs, at the time of the
conquest of Gorkha, was still impure, although acknowledged to be
of the same family with those who pretend to have come from
Chitaur.</p>
<p>The mountains produced copper, lead, and iron, and the <!--
page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>Panar river produced gold; but no mine was of great
value.&nbsp; The chief crop is summer rice, but there is also
much wheat, and some barley.&nbsp; The parts conquered from
Yumila are cold, but abound in pasture, and produce great flocks
of sheep.&nbsp; The whole rents of the mountains, exclusive of
lands granted to Brahmans, amounted to 125,000 rupees a-year, the
whole of which, as usual west from the Kali river, was collected
by the Raja&rsquo;s officers; but since the conquest, much has
been granted to the army of Gorkha.&nbsp; The government is one
of the best in the country, and with the title of Raja, is held
by Brahma Saha, one of the Chautariyas.</p>
<p>There is much intercourse with the part of Thibet subject to
China, which empire in the Khas dialect is called Hung.&nbsp;
Between the countries there are three passes through the southern
ridge of Emodus, Joyar, Dharma, and Beyas.&nbsp; The two last are
the easiest, but they are inferior to Riti in Garhawal.&nbsp;
Beyas is in a portion of Yumila that has been annexed to Almora,
since the conquest by Gorkha.</p>
<p>The country now called Garhawal or Gar, at least in part,
formerly belonged to a petty chief of low birth, but pure
manners, who resided at Chandpur, and paid tribute to
Karuvirpur.&nbsp; About 350 years ago, a Pangwar Rajput, named
Ajayapal, came from the plains, and entered into the service of
the chief of Chandpur, whom he soon after took occasion to
expel.&nbsp; The descendants of Ajayapal paid the customary
tribute to the prince of Karuvirpur, who, as usual in India,
seems to have given himself no concern about these internal
commotions among his tributaries.&nbsp; After Karuvirpur fell,
the Rajas of Chandpur paid tribute to Almora; but, while Lakshmi
Chandra held the latter government, Mahipat Sa, Raja of Garhawal,
at the persuasion of a religious man, who promised success,
declared <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>himself independent.&nbsp; This
person built Srinagar, and made it the capital of his dominions,
on which account his descendants are usually known to Europeans
as Rajas of Srinagar.&nbsp; This chief was succeeded by his son
Syam Sa, who died without male issue, and was succeeded by Futeh
Sa, his uncle&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; This chief incurred a great
stain by delivering up to Aurungzeb one of that king&rsquo;s
brothers, who had taken refuge in the mountains.&nbsp; As a
reward for his treachery he received the Jaygir of Dun and
Chandi, two low country estates.&nbsp; Futeh had two sons,
Upendra and Dilip, and was succeeded by the former, who took from
the chief of Besariya the countries of Ranigar and Barahat, on
the upper parts of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers.&nbsp; When he
died, his lady was pregnant, and no chief was appointed until the
result was known, which shows that the government and succession
were firmly established.&nbsp; The widow having been delivered of
a daughter, Pradipa Sa, the son of Dilip, a boy five years old,
succeeded quietly, and governed seventy-five years.&nbsp; He was
an active prince, administered his affairs with great attention,
and had several wars with Nuzuf Khan, who governed the petty
remains of the Mogul empire.&nbsp; His son and successor was
Lalit Sa, who, as above mentioned, made his younger son Raja of
Kumau.&nbsp; Mention has also been made of the manner in which
this son, named Pradyumna, succeeded his brother as Raja of
Garhawal.&nbsp; After the conquest of Kumau, Jagajit Pangre and
Amur Singha, the officers commanding the army of Gorkha, in
conjunction with Harsha Dev, the turbulent Brahman often already
mentioned, attacked Garhawal.&nbsp; They had fought two years,
and were on the point of succeeding, when they were recalled by
Bahadur Saha, the regent of Gorkha, in consequence of a Chinese
army approaching the capital.&nbsp; The commanders of Gorkha,
especially <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>Jagajit, complied most reluctantly,
and made a peace with Garhawal.&nbsp; The Brahman, their
associate, now considering their affairs desperate, on being
desired to accompany them, treated the request with insolence,
asking who they were, that he should follow.&nbsp; They had,
however, only retired a little way, when information was brought,
that peace had been made with the Chinese, on which the Brahman
immediately fled.</p>
<p>Garhawal enjoyed a respite, until Rana Bahadur returned from
Banaras, when he sent Amar Singha Karyi with 3000 fusileers, and
an equal number of irregulars, to extend his territories to the
west.&nbsp; No pretext, I believe, was held out for the attack;
indeed, so far as I can learn, the natives do not consider the
holding out any pretence as at all necessary or proper in war,
although, in treating with Europeans, they have now learned to
make very appropriate observations on the subject.&nbsp; Rana
Bahadur, on the contrary, when collecting this force, I am
credibly informed, gave very publicly out, that it was destined
to go either to Calcutta or Pekin, he had not exactly determined
which; and had he considered the force adequate, there is no
doubt that he would have made the attempt, although he was on
very good terms with both governments.&nbsp; This violence,
however, was suddenly directed against the helpless Pradyumna,
who made little or no resistance; but with his brothers Parakrama
and Pritama, and his son Sudarsan, retired to Dun, and from
thence to Keni near Haridwar, in the territory then lately
acquired by the Company.&nbsp; There, very contrary to the wishes
of his brother Parakrama, the Raja sold the family throne for
150,000 rupees.&nbsp; This sum enabled him to raise some forces,
with which the three brothers returned to Dun, and fought the
army of Gorkha near Gurudhana.&nbsp; The Raja was killed,
Parakrama escaped to Haridwar, and Pritama, <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>having been
shot through the foot, was taken prisoner, but is kindly used,
and has married a daughter of Brahma Sahi, the governor of
Almora.&nbsp; Sudarsan, the undoubted heir of the family, in
1814, was with Sir Edward Colebroke at Futehgar.&nbsp; He was
then about twenty six years of age, and has, it is said, good
abilities; but was addicted to an expense ill suited to his
means, which were very slender.&nbsp; His uncle Parakrama died
without children, in the country of the Sikhs.</p>
<p>Chandi was taken from the family by Asof ud doulah, the Nawab
Vazir.&nbsp; Dun, having been a Jaygir from Aurungzeb, should
belong to the king at Dilli; but it has been seized by the
government of Nepal.&nbsp; It produced a rent of 50,000 rupees
a-year.&nbsp; The rent of the mountains amounted to 400,000
rupees, the whole levied by the Rajah&rsquo;s officers, but a
large proportion has been granted to the military establishment
by the government of Gorkha.&nbsp; There are three valuable mines
of copper, the Raja&rsquo;s share of which was 76,000
rupees.&nbsp; Salt is imported from Thibet, with which there are
three communications.&nbsp; One, a little west from Ganggotri, is
difficult.&nbsp; The other two lead from the vicinity of
Badrinath.&nbsp; That by Manu has no supply of fuel, but that by
Riti is reckoned the best passage through Emodus, at least in
these western parts.&nbsp; At Tapoban, towards Badrinath, is a
hot spring.&nbsp; Rock crystal abounds in the vicinity of the
snow.</p>
<p>The country near Emodus is very cold, and produces many
sheep.&nbsp; The lower hills are warm, and produce most rice and
wheat, but also many other crops.</p>
<p>Srinagar the capital is in a very hot valley, and contains
about 2000 houses.&nbsp; There is no other town, but many
celebrated places of worship, which seem to have been sacred
among the Hindus for many ages.&nbsp; How these people came to
establish places of worship in countries that, until of late,
were <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>occupied entirely by impure
infidels, can, in my opinion, be only accounted for by supposing,
that, when these places of worship became fashionable, the Hindus
had not become pure, nor had they adopted the faith now reckoned
orthodox.&nbsp; Four of the five places called Prayag, all
celebrated as places of great sanctity for bathing, were in this
principality, as is also the source of the most sacred of rivers,
called therefore the Ganggotri, or source of the river.&nbsp; It
comes from the southern face of the southern ridge of
Emodus.&nbsp; Kedarnath is a temple dedicated to Siva, but the
works are petty, and ruinous.&nbsp; Badrinath, dedicated to
Vishnu, was lately rebuilt at a considerable expense by orders of
Daulat Rao Sendhiya.&nbsp; Near the temple is the village called
Kalap gram.&nbsp; The Hindus, who know nothing of the place
except from books, imagine that many holy persons have retired to
this place, where they have been living for many thousand years,
in quiet expectation of better times.&nbsp; To pilgrims, who go
there in expectation of meeting these personages, a cave is shown
as the place of their residence; but as the cave is filled with
snow, there is no fear of the good folks being disturbed, until
these degenerate times pass away, and the age of gold is
restored.</p>
<p>The whole original tribes have been expelled from this sacred
territory.</p>
<p>West from Garhawal and the Yamuna, is the territory of
Siramaura or Sirmaur, the capital of which is Nahan.&nbsp; It
lately belonged to a family of the Raythaur tribe, which had held
the country for about fifteen generations, and was descended from
a younger son of the Jaysalmer family.&nbsp; The first Raja of
Sirmaur, whom Hariballabh recollects, was Vijay Prakas, who
married a daughter of Jagat Chandra of Kumau.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his son Pradipa Prakas, who, like his father, was a
tame inoffensive man.&nbsp; His son Kirti Prakas <!-- page
303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>succeeded when eight years old, and died in his
twenty-sixth year; but during this period of youth he fought many
battles with the Mogul officers, and took from them Larpur,
Narayangar, Ramgar, and Pangjaur, all on the plains of India; but
he left there untouched Rayapur, which belonged to a Chauhan,
whose sister he had married.&nbsp; He would not consent to pay
any tribute for these acquisitions, but obtained a grant of them
in Jaygir from Ali Gouhur the Mogul, giving 100,000 rupees as a
present.&nbsp; Turning then against his neighbour chiefs, he
strengthened his frontier to the west by the conquest of
Jagatgar, reckoned a very strong place, which had belonged to the
Raja of Nurpur.&nbsp; He also attacked the Raja of Bilaspur, and
wrested from his authority the superiority of twelve petty
chiefs, who did not obtain the title of Raja, but were called
Thakurs or Ranas.&nbsp; These had formerly paid tribute to the
Raja of Bilaspur, and followed the standard of that chief in war;
but these duties were now transferred to the chief of
Sirmaur.&nbsp; This vigorous youth then attacked Garhawal, and
endeavoured to wrest from its chief the fertile territory of Dun;
but he died at Kalsi, after several fruitless battles had taken
place between his brother Iswari Singha, and Lalit Sa, the chief
of Garhawal.&nbsp; This young chief, by three wives, left four
sons, and was succeeded by the eldest, Jagat Prakas, aged ten
years.&nbsp; When in his fourteenth year, he set out for Kangra
to marry the sister of Sangsar Chandra, the chief of that
country; but on the way was met by the Raja of Bilaspur, his
mortal enemy, who refused a passage through his territory.&nbsp;
The youth, with the premature vigour of his family, instantly cut
his way through his opponents, and married the lady.&nbsp; His
brother-in-law wished to persuade him to return by the low
country, and thus to avoid any contest; but the young hero
disdained to show any mark of fear before his bride, and her <!--
page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>brother giving an addition of 2000 men to his suite,
they forced their way back.&nbsp; Having made a pilgrimage to
Jaganath, Jagat Prakas determined to accomplish the conquest of
Dun, which had been relinquished on his father&rsquo;s death, and
he soon succeeded.&nbsp; He died at the age of 28 years, leaving
no male issue, and was succeeded by his brother Dharma
Prakas.</p>
<p>At this period Sangsar of Kangra, having become very violent,
made an attack on the Rajas of Mundi and Bilaspur, who applied
for assistance to Dharma of Sirmaur.&nbsp; This chief having
received from them 200,000 rupees, and having been promised as
much more, joined them with his forces, and the three Rajas
advanced together to fight Futeh Chandra, the brother of Sangsar,
who commanded the forces of Kangra.&nbsp; They were, however,
entirely defeated, and Dharma fell in the battle.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his brother Karna Prakas.&nbsp; Sangsar now
persuaded the Raja of Hanur to turn against his ally and chief,
the Raja of Sirmaur, promising that he would render him
independent, and place him at the head of the twelve chiefs that
had been alienated from Bilaspur, and rendered tributary to
Sirmaur.&nbsp; On this Karna invited to his assistance Amar
Singha, the officer who commanded the forces of the Nepal
government in Garhawal.&nbsp; This officer sent to his assistance
Bhakti Thapa with 1000 fusileers, and these, united to the troops
of Sirmaur, advanced to the west in search of their
enemies.&nbsp; They were soon, however, compelled to retire by
the united forces of Sangsar and Hanur.&nbsp; On this Sangsar
entered into a negotiation with Krishna Singha, the son of Iswari
Singha, the uncle of Karna, and with his assistance plundered the
family of that chief.&nbsp; He fled for assistance to Amar
Singha, who advanced with his whole forces, and soon subdued
Hanur, and the adjacent countries, leaving Karna in the
possession of his estates.&nbsp; <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Afterwards
Amar Singha attacked Kangra; and, when he was compelled by Ranjit
Singha, king of Lahaur, to make a disastrous retreat, he applied
to Karna, requesting an interview.</p>
<p>The chief of Sirmaur, thinking the affairs of the Nepalese
desperate, at least in that quarter, sent an insolent reply, on
which he was immediately attacked by Ranajor, the son of Amar
Singha, and fled without resistance.&nbsp; The troops at Gorkha
then took possession of all his estates on the hills, while
various chiefs seized on those upon the plain.&nbsp; His cousin
Krishna retains Narayangar, which he seized, when he plundered
his kinsman&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Karna lives near Rayapur with
the chief of that place, who is his relation.&nbsp; His wife and
son have gone to Lodhyana, in hope of procuring assistance from
the English.</p>
<p>When the Raythaurs arrived, the territory of Sirmaur was
occupied by two tribes of Khas, called Bhats and Kanets, of which
the former was, as it still is, by far the most numerous, and
they now form the greater part of the cultivators or
Zemindars.&nbsp; Until the arrival of the Raythaurs, it is
admitted that no Brahmans resided in the country; yet Hariballabh
contends, that even then the Kanets and Bhats were not of the
aboriginal infidel Khasiyas, but were descended of pure Sudras,
who had come from the plains, on which their Gurus and Purohits
resided, and made them occasional visits.&nbsp; These Bhats must
not be confounded with the poets or parasites of the plains, and
in their own country do not wear the thread of distinction; but
some, who have gone to the low country, on finding the high rank
which the Bhats there enjoy, have put on the thread, and call
themselves poets.</p>
<p>The mountains of this state produced a rent of 70,000 or
80,000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; The low country gave 200,000.&nbsp;
The chief crops on the mountains were rice and wheat.&nbsp; West
<!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>from the Yamuna there are no mines of copper, and few
even of iron; but one of these is in Sirmaur.</p>
<p>Nahan contained about 1000 houses, mostly built of stone, and
in rather a cool situation.&nbsp; Kalsi, the only other town,
contains about 100 houses.</p>
<p>Hariballabh does not remember the names and situations of all
the twelve petty states governed by Thakurs or Ranas, who were
tributary to Sirmaur, and followed its chief in war.&nbsp; The
tribute was very inconsiderable.&nbsp; Among them were the
following.</p>
<p>Dharmapur belonged to Dalel Singha, a Baghatiya Rajput, who
was killed by the chief of Hanur.&nbsp; The lord (Thakur) did not
live at Dharmapur, but the name of his capital has escaped the
memory of Hariballabh.&nbsp; Taksal is the largest place in the
country, and has about 200 houses.&nbsp; It is the principal mart
for ginger and turmeric, which are produced most abundantly in
the estates of the twelve lords, (Bara Thakurai,) and in
Sirmaur.</p>
<p>The lordship of Arki, east from Dharmapur, belonged to a Gagat
Singha, expelled by Amar Singha, who now has his head-quarters at
the capital of this petty state, a town containing about 300
houses, besides the huts in the cantonments.&nbsp; His force
consists of 3000 fusileers, and 1000 men armed with matchlocks,
but they have a great body of followers, male and female, and
these last are eager and expert plunderers.</p>
<p>The lordship of Kothar was very petty.</p>
<p>Mahalok was a little better.</p>
<p>Bhajji was still better, having an annual rental of 15,000
rupees.</p>
<p>Kengothal was worth about 50,000 rupees a-year.</p>
<p>Kumarsen paid annually 30,000 rupees.</p>
<p>Borbhakan paid 15,000 or 16,000.</p>
<p><!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>Between the three last mentioned there was another
lordship, of which Hariballabh does not recollect the name, nor
does he recollect either the names or situations of the three
remaining lordships.</p>
<p>North from the countries of these lords is Besar, a country of
little value, but its chief was independent, and was called
Raja.&nbsp; Many of his subjects were Bhotiyas, although he
himself was a pure Rajput.&nbsp; The country is very cold, and
produces many sheep.&nbsp; By the side of the Satrudra there is a
very good route to Thibet, and much wool is imported that
way.&nbsp; Rampur, the capital, contained between 400 and 500
houses.&nbsp; Anup Singha, who was lately Raja, died four or five
years ago, leaving an infant son, who was immediately attacked by
the troops of Gorkha.&nbsp; These seized on the capital; but the
Bhotiyas carried their young chief to the fastnesses of the
country, and reject the yoke of strangers.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the Raja of Hanur, whose country
bounds Sirmaur on the west, and whose rebellion and subsequent
invasion of that state introduced the overwhelming power of
Gorkha.&nbsp; The Rajas are of the Chandel tribe, and of the same
family with the chiefs of Kumau and Kahalur.&nbsp; The earliest
Raja that Hariballabh remembers was Bhup Chandra, who was a
violent man, and held not only the country of Hanur on the
mountains, but that of Palasi on the plains.&nbsp; This was worth
50,000 rupees a-year, while the mountains paid about twice as
much.&nbsp; The chiefs did not pay any tribute, but in war they
followed the standard of Sirmaur.&nbsp; Bhup Chandra was
succeeded by his son Gaja Chandra, whose son Rama Chandra joined
Kangra against Sirmaur, as already mentioned.&nbsp; On the
approach of Amar Singha he retired to Palasi, which was saved by
the interposition of Colonel Ochterlony, who threatened to
interfere, and Amar Singha <!-- page 308--><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>contented
himself with the hills.&nbsp; Nalagar, which, until of late, was
the capital of Hanur, contained about 500 houses; but Rama
Chandra built a new town farther in the hills, and Nalagar was
neglected.&nbsp; The new town he called after his own name, as he
does also another town which he has built since he settled on the
plain.</p>

<p>The intelligence procured from Hariballabh extending somewhat
farther west than the present dominions of Gorkha, but to no
great distance, it may be given as a Supplement to the foregoing
Account.</p>
<p>The country between the Satadru or Sutluj and Kasmira in
ancient times belonged to Susarma, a chief of the family of the
Moon, who was a principal ally (Paksha) of Durjadhan, competitor
for the kingdom of India, at the commencement of this iron
age.&nbsp; In the terrible battle, which settled the succession
in the family of his adversaries, Susarma escaped, and his
descendants long governed his country.&nbsp; The genealogy of
this family is said to be contained in the Mahabharat, but is not
to be found in the Sri Bhagwat, or other books from which I have
had the Indian genealogies extracted.&nbsp; The Raja of Kangra
pretends to be descended of this family, which, he alleges, has
enjoyed uninterrupted possession of at least a part of its
original estate, until the present day.&nbsp; The late Rajas,
however, <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>have been called Katauch Rajputs,
for what reason I do not know; and the present chief is said to
be desirous of being called a Chandel, for this tribe is
generally admitted to be descended of the family of the
Moon.&nbsp; Many others, however, allege, that the Katauch tribe
sprang from the sweat of the goddess, spouse to Siva, when she
was cut to pieces; and, when these were scattered by her husband
and Vishnu, her thorax fell at Kangra, which has ever since been
considered as holy; and once, probably, this descent was
considered more honourable than that from the family of the
Moon.&nbsp; No one, in fact, knows the real origin of the family,
which, however, is generally admitted to be old, and to have
consisted of fifty or sixty chiefs, of whom the first is usually
said to have been a Bhup Chandra.&nbsp; Hariballabh does not
remember any of his successors, until the time of Abhay
Chandra.&nbsp; He had three sons, the eldest named Nirbhag C.,
and the youngest Gharnan Singha.&nbsp; The former had no son,
and, when he died, his youngest brother was in the service of
Pradipa of Garhawal, who was then at war with Siva Dev&rsquo;,
the general of Kumau.&nbsp; This crafty Brahman gave the needy
chief 700 Ashrufies of gold, and induced him to withdraw his men,
and return to his own country.&nbsp; On his arrival he found his
brother just dead, and nine or ten of his kinsmen squabbling
about the succession.&nbsp; He therefore took off their heads,
and ascended the throne, (Gadi.)&nbsp; He subdued several Rajas,
such as Kottahar and Ghowasin, became a terror to all the petty
chiefs in the vicinity, and removed the seat of government from
Jaya Singhapur to Sujanpur, which he founded; for the fortress
and town of Kangra had been long in the hands of the
Muhammedans.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his son Tikayit Chandra,
who, in his fourteenth year of age, had a son named Sangsar
Chandra, the present chief.&nbsp; When eighteen years of age,
Tikayit C. was caught by Khan Bahadur, who <!-- page 311--><a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>was
Subahdar of Lahaur under Muhammed Shah.&nbsp; He was confined for
some years, and then restored to liberty, but died at the age of
twenty-five years, leaving the country to his young son.&nbsp;
This youth became the most violent and formidable chief of his
family, and recovered Kangra from the Muhammedans.&nbsp; All the
neighbouring chiefs were then afraid, and he extended his
conquests on the plains by seizing on the estate called Rajawara,
which belonged to the king of Dilli.&nbsp; He removed the seat of
government to Nadaun, but has many places of residence,
especially a fine fortified garden at Alumnagar.&nbsp; I have
already mentioned his dispute with Gorkha, during which Amar
Singha besieged, or rather blockaded, the citadel of Kangra, for
he was in possession of the town.&nbsp; He was opposed by
Anirudha, the son of Sangsar.&nbsp; Bhakti Thapa besieged
Sujanpur, which was defended by Man Singha, brother of Sangsar,
and by Harsha Dev&rsquo;, the warlike Brahman of Kumau, often
already mentioned.&nbsp; Sangsar himself, with a small body of
chosen men, hovered round the besieging armies; but, these being
likely to prevail, he invited to his assistance Ranjit Singha,
who affects to be called king of Lahaur; and with his assistance
the forces of Gorkha were repulsed with great loss.&nbsp; For
this assistance, however, he paid dearly, as he ceded to Ranjit
the fort and city of Kangra, and the fort of Kotta, with a
territory of 50,000 rupees a-year, and all the petty chiefs now
despise his authority, and respect the power of Lahaur.&nbsp; He
still, nevertheless, retains a territory yielding from 900,000 to
1,000,000 rupees a-year.</p>
<p>The town of Kangra is open, and, before the attack by Amar
Singha, contained about 2000 houses.&nbsp; Near it is the temple
of the goddess, which is supposed to contain many rich ornaments
of gold.&nbsp; The fort is the strongest in these parts.&nbsp;
The <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>situation is rather warm.&nbsp;
Kotta, although inferior to Kangra, is considered as a stronghold
of importance.</p>
<p>Sujanpur, which remains to Sangsar, contains about 2000
houses, and is surrounded by lines, which are said to be twelve
coses in circumference, and besides the town, contain twenty-four
villages, in which there may be 3000 houses.</p>
<p>Nadaun, the present capital, contains about 500 houses.&nbsp;
Jwalamukhi was a considerable town, where many Gosaing merchants
had settled; but during the disturbances it was plundered by the
Raja of Gular, who had joined Amar Singha.&nbsp; At this place,
where the tongue of the Goddess fell, in the dispersion of her
members, above-mentioned, there is a small temple, perhaps twenty
feet square.&nbsp; It is paved with large stones, and from a hole
in one corner, perhaps two inches in diameter, there issues a
constant flame, that at the lowest ebb rises about eighteen
inches, but in the rainy season it issues with great violence,
and flame bursts from several parts of the floor, and also from
some places without the temple.</p>
<p>Although most parts of the country are high, the ascents from
the plains below are easy, and the summits of the hills are
level, so that a large proportion is fit for cultivation, and is
well occupied.&nbsp; The poor live much on maize.&nbsp; Great
quantities of rice arc exported to Lahaur, and there is plenty of
sugar-cane.</p>
<p>None of the infidel tribes remain.&nbsp; The most numerous
cast is said to be that called Jat, to which not only the Ranjit
of Lahaur belongs, but also Ranjit of Bharatpur.&nbsp; The tribe
is considered pure, but in Kangra, is not permitted to wear the
thread of distinction, belonging to the military tribe.</p>
<p>Kahalur I have already mentioned as belonging to a branch of
the Chandel family, that governed Kumau and Hanur.&nbsp; It was
always able to resist Kangra, but has been occasionally <!-- page
313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>squeezed by the Muhammedans, and by the Sikhs of
Lahaur.&nbsp; Devi Chandra is the first Raja that Hariballabh
remembers.&nbsp; So long as he lived, he was able to resist all
his neighbours, and entered into a friendship with Prithwi
Narayan of Gorkha, which has continued uninterrupted between
their descendants, so that Maha Chandra, the son of Devi, lives
under the protection of Amar Singha.&nbsp; The family at one time
possessed Govindapur on the plain; but this was long ago seized
by various petty Sikh chiefs.&nbsp; The country on the hills may
produce 100,000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; Bilaspur, the capital, is
the best town in these parts, and contains about 3000 houses,
better built than usual.&nbsp; They consist entirely of stone,
and are two or three stories high, with flat roofs.&nbsp; The air
is very temperate, and snow falls occasionally in winter.</p>
<p>On the west side of the Satadru or Sutluj is one of these
vallies called Dun, which is contained between the great range of
mountains on the north, and a low ridge on the south.&nbsp; This
valley is divided among many petty chiefs.&nbsp; Its east end,
called Bhomor, belonged to a Rajput who had only the title of
Rana: but, although he always leagues himself with some powerful
chief, whom he follows in war, and from whom he receives
protection, he may be called independent, as he pays no
tribute.&nbsp; His revenue may be 8000 or 9000 rupees a-year.</p>
<p>West from Bhomor, the Dun, or valley, is for some way occupied
by petty Sikh or Singha chiefs, who, like all those beyond the
Satadru, are under the king of Lahaur.</p>
<p>Between these Singhas and the territory of Kangra, the hills
are occupied by the petty state of Kottahar, which, as I have
mentioned, was subdued by the chiefs of Kangra; but Mahipat, its
owner, having joined Amar Singha, was by him replaced in his
patrimony, which he retains.&nbsp; Although small, Kottahar is a
fine country, and produces 50,000 or 60,000 <!-- page 314--><a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>rupees a
year.&nbsp; Raypur, the capital, contains between 200 and 300
houses.</p>
<p>West from Kottahar is the lordship of Yasawal, to which belong
part of the hills, and part of the valley or Dun.&nbsp; For its
size, it is exceedingly rich, as it produces about 200,000 rupees
a-year.&nbsp; It belongs to Amed Singha, a pure Rajput, who is
squeezed sometimes by Sangsar and sometimes by Ranjit, and is
compelled to follow them in war.&nbsp; He resides at Rajgar or
Rajpur, which is by nature strong, and contains about 2000
houses.&nbsp; It is colder than Nadaun.&nbsp; The chief possesses
on the plain a fort called Setabgar.</p>
<p>West from Yasawal is the chief of Datarpur, who has also some
territory in the valley and some on the hills.&nbsp; These may
annually produce 40,000 rupees.</p>
<p>West from Datarpur is such another lordship, called Siva, the
revenue of which may be 25,000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; Like the
chief of Datarpur, the lord of Siva is squeezed by both Sangsar
and Ranjit.</p>
<p>On the hills between these two petty chiefs and Kangra is
Gular, whose chief is of the same family with Sangsar, but he
pays tribute to Ranjit.&nbsp; His country is very productive, and
pays about 250,000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; Haripur, his capital,
contains from 1000 to 1500 houses, which are reckoned very well
built.</p>
<p>West from Gular and Siva is Nurpur, the Raja of which
possesses part of the hills, part of the Dun or valley, and part
of the great Indian plain.&nbsp; What he has on the latter is
called Pathankot, from the name of his tribe, for he is a
Pathaniya Rajput, not a Pathan Muhammedan.&nbsp; Dalel Singha,
the last chief, survived his son, and was succeeded by his
grandson, Vir Singha, who married a daughter of Sangsar.&nbsp;
His revenue may be 250,000 rupees a-year.&nbsp; Nurpur, the
capital, contains <!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>about 2500 houses, among whom are
some settlers from Kasmira, who have fifty looms employed in
weaving shawls.</p>
<p>North from Nurpur is an extensive dominion, situated on both
sides of the Rawi, and called Chamba.&nbsp; A long ridge of
mountains, the summits of which are covered with perpetual snow,
separates from the great ridge of Emodus, near the source of the
Bepasa, or Bayas, and, running to the south-east, passes near
Kangra, then crosses the Rawi, and finally bends to the
north-west, towards Kasmira.&nbsp; This ridge, called Pariyat, in
general forms the south-east boundary of Chamba; but, on its
south side, the chief possesses a territory called Rillu.&nbsp;
This was invaded by Sangsar, and Ray Singha, the chief of Chamba,
was killed in its defence.&nbsp; The territory was restored to
Iswari, the son of Ray, on condition of his paying annually
17,000 mans of rice.&nbsp; This tribute was transferred to
Ranjit, along with the fortress of Kangra.</p>
<p>The parts of Chamba beyond the Pariyat mountains are very
cold, and have several communications with Thibet, but
Hariballabh knows that part by report alone.</p>
<p>Separated, in general, by the Pariyat mountains from Chamba,
is the country of Kullu, watered in the centre by the Bayas,
called Bepasa in the Sangskrita, but its territory extends to the
Satadru of the sacred language, which, in the dialect of men, is
called Satarudra.&nbsp; Kullu is extensive, but cold,
mountainous, and barren, producing, however, many sheep.&nbsp;
The grains which grow there are mostly phaphar, chuya, and
uya.&nbsp; The chuya, from the description given, would seem to
be the Holcus sorghum, although the coldness of the situation
renders this doubtful.&nbsp; There is a very good communication
between Kullu and Thibet; and the intercourse has been so free,
that all alliances with the chief, although admitted to be a pure
Rajput, are scouted by the purer inhabitants of the <!-- page
316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>southern mountains.&nbsp; His name is Ratra Singha, the
son of Pritama.</p>
<p>South from Kullu is Mundi, a smaller but better country, which
possesses a mine of iron, and another of culinary salt, the
latter of which is valuable.&nbsp; So far as I can understand the
description, it is a rock salt, very full of impurities, so that
one-half is lost in the processes of lixiviation and evaporation,
which are requisite to fit it for use.&nbsp; The two mines
produce annually a revenue of 150,000 rupees, and the lands
produce as much.&nbsp; The present chief, named Iswari Sen, is a
pure Rajput.&nbsp; Mundi, his capital, contains about 1000
houses, all of stone.&nbsp; Kamalgar, towards the southern
frontier, is reckoned a very strong place, situated on a great
hill.</p>
<p>Sukhet is a narrow territory, hemmed in between Mundi and the
Satadru, which separates both from the dominions of Gorkha.&nbsp;
The Raja Prakas Sen is related to the chiefs of Mundi, and
Sangsar has married his sister.&nbsp; The country produces about
100,000 rupees a-year, but has no mines.&nbsp; Sukhet, the
capital, may contain 500 houses.&nbsp; The Raja possesses a fort
called Dahar, which defends him from the attacks of Kahalur.</p>

<p>During the whole of this month the atmosphere in the valley
was clear, with a sky in general, when not raining, partly
clouded, and partly admitting of sunshine.&nbsp; The clouds
generally hung in patches upon the lower hills, and entirely hid
the snowy mountains.&nbsp; I have marked every day that Emodus
was visible.&nbsp; The pluviometer was erected on the 5th.&nbsp;
My barometer stood a quarter of an inch lower than Captain
Knox&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>OBSERVATIONS FOR AUGUST 1802.</h3>
<p>During the whole of this month, the atmosphere in the valley
was clear, and when not raining, the sky was in part clear, and
in part covered with clouds.&nbsp; These generally hung in
patches on the lower hills, and entirely hid the snowy
mountains.&nbsp; I have marked every day on which these were
visible.&nbsp; The barometer was emptied, and new filled on the
2d, and stood afterwards a little lower, some air having probably
got in, when we removed from Sambhu.&nbsp; A correction of 0.06
may be allowed in the intermediate time.</p>

<p>Except during the fogs, the atmosphere in the valley was clear
throughout this month.&nbsp; The sky was scattered with large
clouds, which at times rested on the faces of the hills.&nbsp;
The thermometer was hung up in an open room.&nbsp; When exposed
to the open air at dawn, it sunk from 4 to 6 degrees lower than
when in the room at noon in the open air, but, well shaded, it
rose about 2 degrees higher than in the room.</p>

<h2>ERRATA</h2>
<p>Which it is hoped the Reader will correct, and in some part
excuse, as, owing to the Author&rsquo;s residing at a distance
from the Printer, the proof-sheets were once only revised, and
this has been found totally inadequate to avoid numerous errors
in printing so many foreign names.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
